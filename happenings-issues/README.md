# Heritage Happenings Issues

This folder contains a number of sub-folders. Each year folder contains a year of _Heritage Happenings_ issues in PDF format

The eventual objective is to capture and make available online all the issues that we can find.

The _Heritage Happenings_ is a monthly publication authored, edited and laid out by Heritage residents.

A future version of this menu will allow you to open the files in their own window. If you wish to do that now, simply remove the "#" mark in the address and reload the page.
