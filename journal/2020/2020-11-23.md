## COVID-19 Heads Up

The census tract for the Heritage is now a San Francisco COVID-19 hotspot.

I am concerned about the residents and Thanksgiving outings. I am planning to self-isolate in some way. I may go down to the dining room and pick up food to bring back to my apartment from Thursday until Sunday.

I have just ordered 20 KN95 masks

Article that implies that family gatherrings nay not be so dangerous

[Small Gatherings Spread the Virus, but Are They Causing the Surge?]( https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/health/coronavirus-holiday-gatherings.html

> As states struggle to contain the resurgent coronavirus, many officials are laying the blame on an unexpected source: people gathering with family and friends.
>
>Household get-togethers undoubtedly do contribute to community transmission of the virus. Canada’s recent Thanksgiving certainly added to its rising cases; such an increase may happen here, too, as the United States embarks on a holiday season like no other. That’s why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday warned so strongly against gathering with others outside the household during Thanksgiving.
>
>But are dinners and backyard barbecues really the engine driving the current surge of infections? The available data do not support that contention, scientists say. Still, the idea has been repeated so often it has become conventional wisdom, leading to significant restrictions in many states.

***

> But in states where a breakdown is available, long-term care facilities, food processing plants, prisons, health care settings, and restaurants and bars are still the leading sources of spread, the data suggest.

I live in a long-term care facility. I will hunker down during the holidays.


## Small mercies

Mantras that are nice to think about and act upon:

* Sitting all day is not a good way
* Walking fast helps you last (live longer)
* There's always a longer way to walk there
* Work is the priority so you must sneak the exercising in through the cracks
* Snippets of exercise every hour gives you power
