# MoMo Read Me

## Concept

The _Heritage Happenings_ is built using two websites.

### Desktop Site

* Designed for large screen use
* Standard Left menu + Right main
* Two modes: All Files & Curated Selection

### Mobile Site

* Set up to support people with cognitive, vision and dexterity issues
* Simple user interface ~ easy to remember
* Adjustable text sizes ~ settings remembered between sessions
* Prevents jiggling fingers from text sliding off screen.

## Road Map

* Add June to Posts under a details tag
* Add automatic search for files
* Button to have the article read out loud
* Button to go to the desktop version of the website

## Issues

* Class names need updating
