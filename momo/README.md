## Concept

The _Heritage Happenings_ is built using two websites.

### Desktop Site

* Designed for large screen use
* Standard Left menu + Right main
* Two modes: All Files & Curated Selection

### Mobile Site

* Set up to support people with cognitive, vision and dexterity issues
* Simple user interface ~ easy to remember
* Adjustable text sizes ~ settings remembered between sessions
* Prevents jiggling fingers from text sliding off screen.

## Road Map

* Swipe to go to next and previous article
* Add June to Posts under a details tag
* Add automatic search for files
* Button to have the article read out loud
* Update pushstate so plain URL appears with no location hash


## Issues

* Class names need updating

### Prompts

Transfer all the set font size code to a separate JavaScript file. Edit the code, so it's in its own namespace. Remove any screen reader code and keyboard shortcuts.

* Gemini Pro 2.5 Preview dis a much simpler job than Claude

Can you suggest, but not carry out, any further improvements?

Can you make anything better??

Can you create a "Heritage Happenings" favicon?
