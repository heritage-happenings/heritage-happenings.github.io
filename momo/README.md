## Concept

The _Heritage Happenings_ is built using two websites.

### Desktop Site

* Designed for large screen use
* Standard Left menu + Right main
* Two modes: All Files & Curated Selection

### Mobile Site

* Set up to support people with cognitive, vision and dexterity issues
* Simple user interface ~ easy to remember
* Adjustable text sizes ~ settings remembered between sessions
* Prevents jiggling fingers from text sliding off screen.

## Road Map

* 2025-07-28 ~ Add page use tracking
* Add June to Posts under a details tag
* Add automatic search for files
* Update push-state so plain URL appears with no location hash

### Read Aloud

* 2025-07-28 ~ Highlight the current text being read  aloud.
* 2025-07-24 ~ choose the voice, use system voice
* 2025-07-24 ~ Start Read Aloud from current Cursor position

### Voice Commends

* 2025-07-24 Add voice commands

## Issues

## Change Log


## 2025-07-28

### Menu Bar

* Moved font size buttons to left, to help prevent you from changing font size by mistake
* Moved read-aloud button to right to it easier and faster to turn voice on and off
* The file icon was removed from the Stories post in order to help with making a more consistent menu body size.
* Updated the top menu bar to a more consistent height, so it is less "jumpy"
* * Menu Bar background is now opaque and does not show the underlying text at all

### Font Sizing

* Two finger pinch to reduce or enlarge the text, has been dropped. It was causing too many random updates. Now you must push the A- or A+ buttons to reduce or enlarge the text.

### ReadAloud

* When ReadAloud is on, the icon has a bar to let you know, you can click again to turn it off.
* When you swipe to a new story, ReadAloud stops reading the old story and starts reading the new story.

### Readability

* Header font sizes have been reduced slightly to make a more consistent text size in each post.

### URL handling

* Homepage now displays with clean URL

### Done

* 2025-07-24 ~ better start and stop indication
* Swipe to go to next and previous article
* Button to have the article read out loud
* Class names need updating

## 2025-07-19

### Prompts

Transfer all the set font size code to a separate JavaScript file. Edit the code, so it's in its own namespace. Remove any screen reader code and keyboard shortcuts.

* Gemini Pro 2.5 Preview dis a much simpler job than Claude

Can you suggest, but not carry out, any further improvements?

Can you make anything better??

Can you create a "Heritage Happenings" favicon?
