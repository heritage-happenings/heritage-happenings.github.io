# Lunch with Legends: Connecting Generations in the Marina

I am a resident of a retirement community, heritage on the Marino comma and San Francisco, California. I am one of the youngest residents here. Although I am moderately disabled comma, it is quite easy for me to get out and about and meet up with other people.

I have recently joined up with Next Village. A non profit organization that organizes young people to volunteer to help the elderly As well as organizing events for the elderly.

Next Village has organized a number of events and activities that I plan to participate in. And I look forward to participating in

I also know that there are a number of residents where I live that are too old and infirm and rarely leave the premises. Their contact with the outside world, and especially with young people, is extremely limited.

I am thinking of organizing a lunch for some of these residents. I would like to invite some of the young people from Next Village to join us. I think it would be a good experience for the young people to meet some of the older residents. And I think it would be a good experience for the older residents to meet some of the young people.

Living here by living here I am gaining experience on how to grow old. I am 77 and yet I have the opportunity to chat with people over twenty five years older than I am. I becoming aware of the challenges that they face. All the cognitive and physical impairments that that affect people lives. These help me be aware of the challenges that I will face in the future.
