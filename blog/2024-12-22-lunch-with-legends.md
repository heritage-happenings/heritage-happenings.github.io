Welcome to my life at Heritage on the Marina, a highly-respected retirement community nestled in the heart of San Francisco's stunning Marina district! At 77, I'm considered one of the "youngsters" here. I made the move during the height of the pandemic. As a partial paraplegic, I was concerned about managing alone if I got sick or injured. But even with my moderate disability, life here is fantastic. I can easily explore our neighborhood and enjoy everything the delightful Marina district offers.

Recently, I became involved with Next Village, a well-organized non-profit that's all about connecting generations. They mobilize young volunteers to support seniors and organize events to keep us engaged and active. Improv classes, writers' workshops, dining out at local gems â€“ I'm ready to dive into all the fantastic activities they offer!

But here's the thing: I see many of my neighbors at Heritage who aren't as fortunate. They're too frail or simply too advanced in age to venture out. Their world can become quite small, especially when it comes to interacting with younger people. And that's something I'm determined to change.

My idea? Simple yet powerful: Let's bring the generations together over lunch right here in our own dining room! I'm envisioning a program where we invite the engaged volunteers from Next Village to share a meal with our less mobile residents. Imagine the conversations, the stories swapped, the laughter shared! These young volunteers could gain invaluable insights into a life well-lived, while our seniors could bask in the youthful energy and fresh perspectives.

Living at Heritage has given me a front-row seat to the aging process. I have the privilege of chatting with folks who are 20, even 25 years my senior. These conversations are eye-opening, offering a glimpse into the cognitive and physical realities of advanced age. It's like a sneak peek into my own future, helping me prepare for what lies ahead.

My hope is that these intergenerational lunches will be more than just a meal; they'll be a chance to learn, to connect, and to celebrate the art of aging gracefully. And did I mention our dining room? It's top-notch, serving up culinary delights that cater to every palate and dietary need imaginable. So, let's break bread, share stories, and bridge the generations, one delicious meal at a time!
