# Visiting Speaker Series Proposal

## Problem

* Residents enjoy listening to engaging talks from authors and experts in various fields.
* Finding and booking speakers who captivate a primarily older audience can be challenging.
* The current Life Enrichment Team is often stretched thin when trying to fulfill this need.

## Possible Solution

NEXT Village (see attached reference) is initiating a visiting speaker series program that could be leveraged to benefit Heritage residents.

The program would feature local authors, artists, and others who have done intriguing things in their lives. As an example, NEXT member Mary-Rose Hayes has written books in a variety of genres, including two in collaboration with Senator Barbara Boxer.

The series could feature Heritage residents, NEXT members, and other local figures who have interesting stories to share.

In this partnership, NEXT Village would identify and book the speakers, and Heritage would provide the venue and an audience comprising a mix of residents and NEXT members.

Mary Lindy and Roxana Lara have both expressed interest in pursuing this opportunity. The Residents Council has approved the concept in principle, pending further details.

## Proposal

Heritage proposes partnering with NEXT Village to host a visiting speaker series for residents and NEXT members.

The Residents Council is asked to approve this proposal so that Roxana may proceed with discussions with NEXT Village to formalize the partnership.
