# 21 Nice Things About the Heritage

## Introduction

I am an architect, designer and software programmer. I observe, decide and tabulate many aspects of my life.

Over the past decade I have considered the issues of being an aging, disabled single person.

The following is a short summary of observations gathered since I moved to the Heritage on August 5, 2020.

There are three sections: Premises, community, support & services - with seven bullet points each.

The first five bullet points are things that give happiness. The last two bullet points in each section deal with beauty and security.

Each bullet pint has two parts

1. Choices and circumstances I was facing prior to moving here
2. Outcomes or results arising from the move to the Heritage


## Premises

Location, neighborhood, premises, facilities, apartment, beauty & security

### 1. "Location location location" ~

* You decide whether to move or to stay put. A major element of that choice is the location. [‘There are three things that matter in property: location, location, location.’]( https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/magazine/28FOB-onlanguage-t.html ).
* Life at the Heritage means you have access to all all three! San francisco is a:
	* Best place to live: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/0
	* Major tourist attraction ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourist_attractions_in_the_United_States
	* Most educated city ~ https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-23/ranking-america-s-most-educated-cities


### 2. "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood." - Mr Rogers ~ Neighborhood & Walking

* You live in a place surrounded by fences and parking lots, paving stones and manhole covers - all occasionally accented by rectangles of grass and some bushes. Driving while being aged can be risky. Walking can be dangerous. Good shops, restaurants and other amenities are far away. Daily life turns to staying at home and ordering in.
* Life at the Heritage means
	* Ambiance: You can select: urban ( Chestnut Street), sporty ( the play ground), bayside ( Marina Green )
	* [Walkability]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkability ): [Walk score]( https://www.walkscore.com/score/3400-laguna-st-san-francisco-ca-94123 )
	* Commerce: Apple picks locations judiciously - just three stores in San Francisco - Marina store is just a short walk - because the shops, restaurants and services a magnet
	* Demographics: all age-groups, ethnicities, rich and not so rich live in the neighborhood
	* Geography: No day is too hot or too cold. Walkers can choose flat or hills
	* Safety: crime and disease statistics are low. Acceptable social distancing


### 3. "[Friluftsliv]( https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20171211-friluftsliv-the-nordic-concept-of-getting-outdoors )" ~ being outdoors ~ living outside

or

### 3. "How does your garden grow?" ~ gardens and landscaping

* "There is no there there". Going out takes an effort to get to some joy. Your daily life turns to sitting in a chair with papers or devices and just looking at them.
* Life at the Marina is to live surrounded on three sides by seven flower gardens and terraces, playing fields and a national park - with views of the Bay, mountains and hundreds of trees - all in middle of the city noted for its beauty.
* Life  at the Heritage is about being outside, enjoying flowers and hummingbirds in the garden, taking walks, seeing and being seen.
	* Entrances on three sides of the property enable multiple walking routes right from the get-go
	* Gardens and landscaping in all sides of the premises
	* Flowers at your fingertips
	* Gardens on every terrace on every floor
	* City views from fourth floor


### 4. "My Father's house has many mansions" - John 14:2 KJV ~ facilities shared by the residents

* You live in small place without much. Or you live in large abodes but use only a small portion. And, whatever the size, the place lacks amenities you would like.
* Life at the Heritage provides resident access to living rooms, kitchens, pianos, art studios, treatment rooms and salons. It's a huge place, with many facilities and opportunities. You get to decide the parts you want to use.
	* Long inside walks
	* Gathering places
	* Communal Dining room
	* Two pianos
	* Organ
	* Two libraries
	* Chapel
	* Art room with supplies
	* Computers and printers
	* Exercise facility
	* Lounges and kitchens everywhere
	* Balcony terraces
	* Board room
	* Library
	* Cottage
	* Storage
	* Laundry
	* Hairdresser Salon
	* Parking lot

### 5. Living Spaces ~ private places

* The space you live in when you are younger may not be the space you want, need or can afford when you are older. A space when you are older should be designed for older people
* Life at the Heritage means that comfort (air, light and temperature) ~ safety (accident, health and person) ~ and convenience ( storing, bathing, dressing ) are all taken into consideration and maintained to the latest and highest standards
	* you have three choices not so small, small and quite small -  but none are too small
	* Heating individually controlled by room
	* Lighting
	* Blinds
	* Fire alarms and smoke detectors
	* Multiple cable, power and phone outlets
	* Emergency buzzers by bed and by toilet
	* Reasonable with Container Store "Elfa" fittings
	* Fall risk protection


### 6. "Walk in beauty" ~ beauty is an essential element to the good life ~ visual and tangible

* You live in places because of price, convenience and availability. Living in beauty is not usually high on your list. Many old people live in places they have lived in for a long time and those places have aged with them. The beauty of the old place has become commonplace.
* Life at the Heritage means living in beauty. One of the most beautiful places in the World is San Simeon. The Heritage was designed by the same architect - Julia Morgan is one of the most beautiful places in San Francisco. Julia Morgan once said: "My buildings will be my legacy... they will speak for me long after I'm gone.". Julia, we in the Heritage hear you loud and clear every day we live here! Life at the Heritage means you walk in beauty every day.


### 7. Security of place ~ Environmental security

* As an elderly person you may begin to fear things. Being injured because you become a "fall risk" or become hoarders,  or by being easily distracted, or simply by just living alone. Natural events cause you to be oo hot or too cold and you are rendered helpless.
* Life at the Heritage means, for example, that there are handrails on both sides of the stairs, that everywhere is wheelchair accessible, that there's always an emergency button with reach. Security and medical staff can be by your side in seconds
* Life in the Heritage means living in a place that has reinvented itself continuously since 1853. From technologies like emergency buttons and WiFi to outsourced catering and earthquake retro-fitting the Heritage is a living, self-improving creation. Institutional protection is built-in. One of the great reinventions - seventy five years after foundation - was asking Julia Morgan to design the premises on Laguna Street to be constructed in earthquake resistent reinforced concrete. Life in the Heritage gives you a cozy feeling of great of security.
