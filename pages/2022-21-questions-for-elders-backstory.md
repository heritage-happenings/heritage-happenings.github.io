# 21 questions for elders: the back story

This is the umpteenth draft of a work-in-progress. And it's only the beginning. The second half will be my answers to these questions from my perspective as a resident at the Heritage on the Marina and from my perspective as a (former) resident of The Gateway apartments.

## Uses

* To assist elders and their elder-care team identify and gauge their best elder-life future opportunities
* To assist elders to gauge, compare and contrast the success of the current elder-life residences
	* For example to help members of various independent living communities compare their experiences
	* To help identify and share beat practices
* To assist elder-care residents associations in defining the mission and vision
* To assist geriatric care providers in developing a mission and vision for their elder-care operations


## Building the document

The following is an outline of the thought process used to build the document "21 Questions for Elders".

Let’s say you are tasked to investigate an unfamiliar topic. What to do? Where to start the research?

Somebody said: “Poor artists copy. Great artists steal.” Well if you are going to copy or steal, you might as well take from the best: “Might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb”

Thus the first step is to go find some giants.


## “Standing on the shoulders of giants”

"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants"

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants

The phrase “Standing on the shoulders of giants” is a metaphor which means "Using the understanding gained by major thinkers who have gone before in order to make intellectual progress"

* Base my observations/thinking/recommendations on evidence, prior example, clinical research
* Be transparent: provide links to the original research
* Maintain a neutral point of view
* Link to free content
* Cite verifiable sources

“Poor artists copy. Great artists steal.”

If I am to create a vision statement I might as well stand on the shoulders of the most excellent vision statements already written.

The first thing to do is to build a list of the things you want to do. Here we start with a special kind of list: a checklist.

## The Checklist: an exercise in balancing completeness versus usability


A checklist is a list of all the things that you need to do, information that you want to find out, or things that you need to take somewhere, which you make in order to ensure that you do not forget anything.
* https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/checklist

The intent of this paper is to "cover all the bases". Every possible topic that a person may consider has a slot in the list.

On the other hand if every imaginable question is listed here, the document will be far too lengthy for anybody to complete

The intent is that even if a exact destination if not in the file, a suitable slot is easy to identify.

The history, structure and benefits of checklists is covered in a work-in-progress here: https://theo-armour.github.io/2022/#pages/goals/checklists.md


## The Checklist: a design tool

I use checklists to help me get a project off the ground. Parsing a bad checklist may be better than staring at a blank page.

I have not documented my thoughts this process or concept to any depth. So, of course, I have added this task to my do To Do list

A To Do list is also checklist - but not at all the one being discussed here. ;-)

So where do we start in building a check list? What do the giants do?

It's simple, simple, simple: Giants divide things by three.

## Triad and Trichotomy

Dividing things into three piles is always a good place to start. Plato does it. Kant does it. Hegel does it. Newton does it.

What Are you waiting for?

Here's the backstory on triads: https://theo-armour.github.io/2022/#pages/mental-models-wisdom/triads-trichotomy.md

The triad we will build is based on: Knowing, Being and Doing

In this instance, here is the work-in-progress

Place is a proxy for Knowing
* The underlieing triad for place is of course: location, location, location
* Location, Place, Premise ~ the physical, the what's there, the where
* It's about things that last a long time like streets and buildings

People is a proxy of Being
* Community, people, staff and residents ~ the who & the why
* Time: timeless as in "best friends forever!"

Operations is a proxy for Doing
* Organization, support and services ~ the what & when & how
* Time: now, event-driven

## Fear of empty spaces: _horror vacui_

In visual art, _horror vacui_, Latin for 'fear of empty space'), also referred to as _kenophobia_ (from Greek for 'fear of the empty'),is the filling of the entire surface of a space or an artwork with detail. In physics, _horror vacui_ reflects Aristotle's idea that "nature abhors an empty space."

The idea here is that whenever we create a sub-topic or even sub-sub-sub topic, Can we automatically populate it with something juicy to consider?

See:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(computer_science)

> A default, in computer science, refers to the preexisting value of a user-configurable setting that is assigned to a software application, computer program or device. Such settings are also called presets or factory presets, especially for electronic devices.

> Default values are standards values that are universal to all instances of the device or model and intended to make the device as accessible as possible "out of the box" without necessitating a lengthy configuration process prior to use. The user only has to modify the default settings according to their personal preferences. In many devices, the user has the option to restore these default settings for one or all options. Such an assignment makes the choice of that setting or value more likely, this is called the default effect.

Given that our project has something to do with humans, can we establish sub-topics that affect all humans?

## Human needs

It turns there are some giants in the space. Maslow's "hierarchy of needs" springs to mind.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs

Many more links and snippets here:
* https://theo-armour.github.io/2022/#pages/goals/needs-rights-goals.md

It turns out that most all humans fear some things and want other things.

In other words:

* Humans have a need for safety and freedom for fear or: security
* Humans want many things of all kinds, but simply put humans seek: beauty

Thus for every topic we create, we can immediately type in "security" and "beauty" on the page and, thankfully. the page is not blank from the get go.

OK, now every topic has two sub-topics. How many more do we need? Could there be too many sub-topics?



## The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two

> "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information" is one of the most highly cited papers in psychology. It was written by the cognitive psychologist George A. Miller of Harvard University's Department of Psychology and published in 1956 in Psychological Review. It is often interpreted to argue that the number of objects an average human can hold in short-term memory is 7 ± 2. This has occasionally been referred to as Miller's law.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two

Thus if we want to be user-friendly, it means that each of our three topics should have a maximum of seven sub-topics - or 21 sub-topics in total. We already have security and beauty in all three, Where are we going to find the other 15?

Sadly, you will have to complete the rest of this homework project yourself. Nonetheless seen free to plagiarize and steal from any of the following sources!

## "But wait! There's more!"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Popeil

> Ronald Martin Popeil (May 3, 1935 – July 28, 2021), was an American inventor and marketing personality, and founder of the direct response marketing company Ronco. He made appearances in infomercials for the Showtime Rotisserie and coined the phrase "Set it, and forget it!" as well as popularizing the phrase, "But wait, there's more!" on television as early as the mid-1950s.


Let us say, you have written a paper - using some of the above ideas or even none of them. Let us even add the notion that your paper has been proofread a zillion times and must therefore be grammatically and syntactically correct. Is there not still the haunting question running through your mind: "Is my paper any good?"

Actually, there may be no better question. Here is some background:

When programmers write computer programs, one of the things they are are frequently tasked to do is to build a second program that has the simple duty of testing the first program. The usual idea is for the second program to enter some valid data and then some invalid data and see if the first program operates as expected.

Well, is there any way of testing your writing in a similar way? Is there a good checklist you can draw upon?

Thank goodness: those giants have been at it again. You asked "Is my paper any good?"

It turns out that the giants have been asking themselves "What is good?" for a very long time. And they even started documenting and recording their thoughts a number of thousands of years ago.

The gods being gods probably got fed up with people saying "Good god!" so the told the giants call these things "virtues".

Here is the astounding thing: even with the complexity of human life, with the crazy things we do, and with the millennia of existence it turns out the the total number of all the possible virtues, of all the ways of being any good is merely: 24.

The 24 virtues and their parsing is described here:

https://theo-armour.github.io/2022/#pages/goals/virtues.md

Thus you can test your paper yourself. Go through your 21 questions; dream up possible answers; then verify if any of the answers correspond with any of the 24 virtues. If all the answers have no virtues or all the answers are always virtuous than you have a question of no good utility.


## Conclusions

Using the above methods, I can generally produce a “good enough to discuss” document within a day or two. Given more time, as with this document, it is easy to add more data and edit existing data and incorporate comments from readers. If you have found a good set of giants, then you have the pleasure in knowing that your effort is as good as it gets.
