# 21 questions for elders: the back story

This is the umpteenth draft of a work-in-progress. And it's only the beginning. The second half will be my answers to these questions from my perspective as a resident at the Heritage on the Marina and from my perspective as a (former) resident of The Gateway apartments.

## Checklists: an exercise in balancing completeness versus usability

The intention

A checklist is a list of all the things that you need to do, information that you want to find out, or things that you need to take somewhere, which you make in order to ensure that you do not forget anything.

The intent of this paper is to "cover all the bases". Every possible topic that a person may consider has a slot in the list.

On the other hand if every imaginable question is listed here, the document will be far too lengthy for anybody to complete

The intent is that even if a exact destination if not in the file, a suitable slot is easy to identify.
