# 21 questions for elders: the back story

This is the umpteenth draft of a work-in-progress. And it's only the beginning. The second half will be my answers to these questions from my perspective as a resident at the Heritage on the Marina and from my perspective as a (former) resident of The Gateway apartments.

## Uses

* To assist elders and their elder-care team identify and gauge their best elder-life future opportunities
* To assist elders to gauge, compare and contrast the success of the current elder-life residences
	* For example to help members of various independent living communities compare their experiences
	* To help identify and share beat practices
* To assist elder-care residents associations in defining the mission and vision
* To assist geriatric care providers in developing a mission and vision for their elder-care operations


## Building the document

The following is an outline the the thought process used to build the document

## “Standing on the shoulders of giants”

"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants"

* Stand on the shoulders of giants. Base my observations/thinking/recommendations on evidence, prior example, clinical research
* Be transparent: provide links to the original research
* Maintain a neutral point of view
* Link to free content

If I am to create a vision statement I might as well stand on the shoulders of the most excellent vision statements already written.

The first thing to do is to build a list of the things you want to do. Here we start with a special kind of list: a checklist.

## The Checklist: an exercise in balancing completeness versus usability

The intention

A checklist is a list of all the things that you need to do, information that you want to find out, or things that you need to take somewhere, which you make in order to ensure that you do not forget anything.
* https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/checklist

The intent of this paper is to "cover all the bases". Every possible topic that a person may consider has a slot in the list.

On the other hand if every imaginable question is listed here, the document will be far too lengthy for anybody to complete

The intent is that even if a exact destination if not in the file, a suitable slot is easy to identify.

The history, structure and benefits of checklists is covered in a work-in-progress here: https://theo-armour.github.io/2022/#pages/goals/checklists.md


## The Checklist: a design tool

I use checklists to help me get a project off the ground. Parsing a bad checklist may be better than staring at a blank page.

I have not documented my thoughts this process or concept to any depth. So, of course, I have added this task to my do To Do list

A To Do list is also checklist - but not at all the one being discussed here. ;-)

So where do we start in building a check list? What do the giants do?

It's simple, simple, simple: Giants divide things by three.

## Triad

Dividing things into three piles is always a good place to start. Kant did it. Nietsche did it

Knowing - Being - Doing

place - people - operations
