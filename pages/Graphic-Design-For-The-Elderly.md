### Best practices:
* Short-term memory and episodic memory are particularly vulnerable so when possible, introduce product features gradually over time instead of all at once
* Don’t divide screens into multiple actions — one focus at once will have better results
* Give clear feedback on progress and completion
* Provide reminders and alerts as cues for habitual actions
* Use subtitles for any voice/video
* Use breadcrumbs or make it clear how to get back to the home page
* No text overlaid on images or graphics
* Simple plain backgrounds are better to avoid distraction
* Be explicit: make the purpose of the product clear
### Avoid assumptions:
* Second guess everything you ever knew about UI design before
* Seniors may not understand things like scrolling or search functionality
* The elderly may not recognize common abbreviations or acronyms (especially those with dementia)
* The elderly have much longer attention spans than younger people so long-form text and deep content is ok as long as they don’t have to divide their attention
* Icons and symbols are less clear, especially the hamburger menu. When using icons and symbols always pair them with text
### Fonts:
* Let people adjust text size themselves, if possible
* Font 16px minimum
* Sans serifs are the best typefaces to use
* Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, Futura, Avant Garde, Verdana
* Avoid using multiple fonts
* Avoid using condensed fonts
* Use type weight to make a clear hierarchy (bold v regular)
### Colors:
* Avoid blue for important interface elements
* Don’t use color to convey a message
* Red & green are the hardest colors to differentiate for color blindness
* High contrast is best, especially within color value (navy & light blue or black & white)
* Check your designs by using online visual impairment simulators and converting designs to grayscale to make sure they are still legible
### Choosing a device:
* Avoid small-screen devices, older people are the largest users of tablets.
* Seniors perform better using touch interfaces (finger tapping declines later than some other motor skills)

* Pay particular attention to contrast ratios with text.
