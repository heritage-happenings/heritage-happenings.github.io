# Mission for an independent liciving community residents assoctation





## Preface


This document provides 21 statements intended to help you gather the input needed to help you and your association agree to a decision about your future life.

You may use this checklist to help you decide whether you should live in place or move somewhere else. Even if you decide that you are a stay-at-home, you will still need to find good responses to all the items in this checklist. Other versions of these questions assist other outcomes for other uses. All of this and more is covered in "21 questions: the back story"


_The wording of each question needs further definition and clarifying of the meaning. The bullets with aspects to consider need further augmenting and completing. The mission is to have the greatest coverage with the fewest questions._
