# 21 questions for elders





## Preface

One day you look in the mirror and say to yourself "Wow! I look just like the old people!"

When thoughts like these start to happen, it is a good time to ask question such as these:

* "Is where I live now where I want to be from now on?"
* "Will I want to live here (wherever you live now) in my nineties and beyond"
* "Will my friends and family want me here when I am a fall risk, have dementia or have had a stroke?"
* "Will I be lonely, become a hoarder or retreat into unhealthy habits if I stay here?"
* "Will I become a burden on my friends and family; will I disrupt the career plans of others so that they may look after me; will the time spent fussing over me take time away from being with my grandchildren and other descendants?"

This document provides 21 questions intended to help you gather the input needed to help you and your elder-care team (you have one, don't you?) agree to a decision about your future life.

You may use this checklist to help you decide whether you should live in place or move somewhere else. Even if you decide that you are a stay-at-home, you will still need to find good responses to all the items in this checklist. Other versions of these questions assist other outcomes for other uses. All of this and more is covered in "21 questions for elders: the back story"



_The wording of each question needs further definition and clarifying of the meaning. The bullets with aspects to consider need further augmenting and completing. The mission is to have the greatest coverage with the fewest questions._
