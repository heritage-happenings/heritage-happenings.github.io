# 2021 Healthy Diets for Seniors

## Introduction

One of the great pleasures of every day life for seniors is simply to eat food.

Less simple is the task of organizing the provisioning process so that it delivers food that is tasty, healthy and sustainable. One might say that this is an, heh heh, all-consuming task

In several circumstances, this web pages begins to address the question: What foods should I be eating?

* As a senior living at home deciding what menu works for you
* As a person responsible for the well-being of a senior
* As a resident in a senior community

In all of these circumstances, you need to decide if:

* The product you are looking at on a supermarket shelf wil be tasty, healthy and sustainable
* The diet in a prospective location will meet expectations
* The food being served to you and your fellow residents is what you want or need

You need to consider:

* Availability
* Cooking skills
* Facilities
* Cost
* Seasons
* Nutrition
* Allergies
* Delivery and storage
* And cornucopia of other issues

In all these cases, a good way forward is to attempt to look at diet through the eyes of an educated and professional dietician nutritionist - a person educated to respond tastefully to all these issues.

The following sections contain the names of organizations, publications, websites and more that you in your role as a "dietician" may tend to refer to in coming to a decision on what is good to eat.

It is long and will never be finished because new research, learning and products just seem to sprout up whenever. Currently it's mostly just a curated list of links - a cup of coffee before breakfast.

Fingers crossed that one day there will be a simple one-pager, er, menu that captures a summary of the tips and hints that would whet the appetite of a registered dietician.

### Shopping Goals

What should I be thinking about when thinking about shopping food?

Concentrate on ingredients that are:

* Readily available, reasonably priced
* Fresh, organic, without additives
* Low sodium, high protein

Ingredients or products available at my local Safeway (or by Safeway delivery).

Shop every two or three days (my local Safeway is across the street).

Food should be from the outside walls of the supermarket - fresh and perishable.

Everything is eaten. No food is thrown away.


### Shopping Hints

* Look at the expiry dates
* Look at the nutrition infobox of everything
	* Check number of servings per packet
	* Salt is the usual worst culprit followed by sugar
* Carry a market bag
* Order online and go to the store. Both are good
* Short frequent trips to the market - helps with getting more walking
* Deli products have no nutrition info
