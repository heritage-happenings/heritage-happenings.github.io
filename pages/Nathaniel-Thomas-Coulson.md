# "Gift by Dr Nat T Coulson"

In the Porter Garden at the Heritage on the Marina there is a pedestal with a bronze plaque at the base.

The following is an investigation into the person named on the plaque along with findings on the origins of the pedestal and plaque.

Summary:

* Dr Nat Coulson was a dentist, investor and benefactor who provided the funds for the Grace Cathedral Carillon
* The plaque and pedestal were formerly the base of sundial donated to "Pine Street House" on June 15 1934
* The 1940 US Census lists Dr Coulson living at 2507 Pine Street - also known as the Crocker Old People's Home
* In the early 1950s the Crocker Old People's Home merged with The Society for the Protection of Women and Children. A lot of the period furniture in Morgan came from Crocker, as did men. And most likely: Coulson's gift
* The current whereabouts of the sundial is unknown

_A tip of the hat to Jean Fowler for noting the following_

> I have not seen this before, but I suspect this was originally given to the Crockers Old People's home which in the early 50s merged with The Society for the Protection of Women and Children which was our original name. A lot of the period furniture in Morgan came from Crocker, as did men!

* ARTHUR PAGE BROWN, architect

> The Old People's Home was originally four stories high, with a wonderfully complex shingled hip roof with flared edges, multiple dormers and pointed turrets. It was designed by the important architect, Arthur Page Brown, and funded by the Crocker estate. The remaining rhythmic curving bays with patterned shingles and arched 1st floor windows enliven the street facades. The corner entrance is impressive in its subtle detail and restraint, allowing it to blend with residential surroundings. This was an early and creative example of housing for the elderly.


## Wikipedia: Grace Cathedral Carillon

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Cathedral,_San_Francisco#Carillon

> The carillon was the gift of Nathaniel T. Coulson, a San Francisco dentist and realtor who came from Lostwithiel in Cornwall. When Coulson first arrived in San Francisco in 1875, he found his way to Grace Church, which lacked a bell tower. Although a Methodist, he vowed to provide bells for the church and eventually spent his life savings to realize his dream and to erect the Singing (north) Tower to house them. The carillon consists of forty-four bronze bells, cast and tuned at the Gillett & Johnston Foundry of Croydon, England, in 1938. The bells arrived before the cathedral tower was completed, so they spent their first years on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay as the centerpiece of the 1939-40 Golden Gate International Exposition. The carillon was first played from its Singing Tower home on Christmas Eve, 1940, and was formally dedicated in 1943. The bells have been rung to mark a number of important events, including D-Day and the centenary of the San Francisco cable car system.

> Grace Cathedral’s bell carillon was the gift of Dr. Nathaniel T. Coulson (1853-1945), a British-born orphan and seaman, become San Francisco dentist and investor. Coulson gave his fortune to build the north or Singing Tower of the cathedral (1939-1941), and to supply it with a carillon of forty-four bronze bells from the Gillet and Johnston bell foundry in Croydon, England (cast 1937-1938). During his last years he lived on a dollar a day to realize his goal. He lived to see the tower and carillon dedicated by Dean Thomas Wright in 1943. Coulson wanted his ashes be placed in the tower crypt, but his wish was delayed. In 1990, on the fiftieth anniversary of the bell installation, his ashes were moved from nearby Cypress Lawn columbarium to the new cathedral columbarium, located below his carillon, in his own Singing Tower

* The dates in text and on plaque correspond
* The plaque in the garden has the quote: “May the coming hour overflow with joy!”

> Still we find our beloved character intent on joy for others; when in his eightieth year he presented to the folks on Pine Street, San Francisco, on June 18, 1934, a lovely sun-dial, installed on the spacious lawn with the following inscription: —
>
> “May the coming hour overflow with joy!”
>
> Accompanying the gift were the following lines written by the doctor:

> “You are the Folks I’m glad to know,
> You are the Folks that cheer me so;
> Whatever of joy or woe I miss,
> In the ‘Pine Street House’ I’m sure of this;
> I equally value your friendship true,
> And wish there were more in the world like you"
