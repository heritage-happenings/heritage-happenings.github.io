## San Francisco Fleet Week Association

### History

San Francisco Fleet Week (SFFW) began in 1981 when then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein led the nation in celebrating America's sea services.

Taking place every October in San Francisco over Italian Heritage Weekend, SFFW's air show, the parade of ships and many community events have become a significant and integral part of the city's local culture and economy.

SFFW also features a unique training and education program that brings together civilian and military forces to develop and share best practices in humanitarian assistance.

SFFW creates important and lasting relationships for its partners and generates over $10M in annual revenue for the city. SFFW is now recognized by the United States Department of Defense as the model for fleet weeks across the country.

### Mission

San Francisco Fleet Week is an annual public event that honors the contributions of the men and women of the United States Armed Forces while advancing cooperation and knowledge among civilian- and military-based Humanitarian Assistance personnel.
