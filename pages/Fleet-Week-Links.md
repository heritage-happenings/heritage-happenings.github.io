# Fleet Week Links

## Preface

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_(poem)


> The fog comes on little cat feet. It sits looking over harbor and city on silent haunches and then moves on.

So said Carl Sandburg in 1916. It's perhaps one of the few poems I can recite almost verbatim. It is an evocative poem, but in the background I do wonder "what is the sound of one haunch being noisy?". No matter. The poem was written about Chicago harbor.

The interesting thing is that this poem is the opposite of Fog City during Fleet Week. Here:

"The fighter rides a little jet fan. It spins looking over harbor and city with a gonzo engine and then flies on."

Anyway, while these playthings of war are here, we can appreciate or depreciate them in a variety of ways. A nice easy way it to walk to Aquatic Park or Marina Green and have a look.

But me being me, I have to see what I can see while simply staring into a computer monitor. This is acceptable as long as I look out the newly-washed windows at the real thing from time to time.

The following text provides access to a number of links that may help you learn about and view the Fleet Week Airshow and its history.

## San Francisco Fleet Week Association

### History

San Francisco Fleet Week (SFFW) began in 1981 when then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein led the nation in celebrating America's sea services.

Taking place every October in San Francisco over Italian Heritage Weekend, SFFW's air show, the parade of ships and many community events have become a significant and integral part of the city's local culture and economy.

SFFW also features a unique training and education program that brings together civilian and military forces to develop and share best practices in humanitarian assistance.

SFFW creates important and lasting relationships for its partners and generates over $10M in annual revenue for the city. SFFW is now recognized by the United States Department of Defense as the model for fleet weeks across the country.

### Mission

San Francisco Fleet Week is an annual public event that honors the contributions of the men and women of the United States Armed Forces while advancing cooperation and knowledge among civilian- and military-based Humanitarian Assistance personnel.
