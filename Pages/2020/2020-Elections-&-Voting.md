Tracking your ballot - when it is mailed, received, and counted - has never been easier.

You can track your ballot by signing up for the “Where’s My Ballot?” tool. It will notify you via phone or email when your ballot has been counted.

## Voters Choice Act

* https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voters-choice-act

The California Voter’s Choice Act is a new law (PDF) passed in 2016 that will modernize elections in California by allowing counties to conduct elections under a new model which provides greater flexibility and convenience for voters.
This new election model allows voters to choose how, when, and where to cast their ballot by:

* Not San Francisco - yet
* Mailing every voter a ballot
* Expanding in-person early voting
* Allowing voters to cast a ballot at any vote center within their county
