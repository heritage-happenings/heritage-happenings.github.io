# The Joys of Aging

Twelve topics of the month to bring you joy in the year 2025.

Aging and being eaten to death by goldfish are probably similar experiences.

But there are moments of joy.

Every month, we explore a different topic.

As a whole the twelve topics cover the full range of human experience.

Each topic covers activities that may, fingers crossed, bring joy.

The content for the topic of the month might include:

* A relevant quote
* Things you can do
* Targets you can achieve
* Metrics you can measure yourself
* Reminders
* Links to five web pages of interest
* Links to podcast or video
* Taboo topics (things not to do)
* Nominate an example of a good human practitioner of the topic
* A relevant infographic
* A poem or song or joke
