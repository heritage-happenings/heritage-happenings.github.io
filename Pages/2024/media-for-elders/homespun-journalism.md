A repository of the stories of people. Bits and pieces of text written by normal people in the normal ways they write. A collection of thoughts of people reflecting upon about their lives.

From my experience, the thoughts will be short snippets of text under 500 words long. They will relate to past experiences, quite anecdotal. They will provide a glimpse into people's lives.

All the thoughts are kept on a repository on Github. From here they may be curated and published in various ways. They may be backed up ti internet archives.

From time to time some of the thoughts are put into newsletters for seniors and others. Occasionally thoughts are collected and published on the Internet using things like Medium or Substack. Perhaps some of the thoughts are collected and curated by editors and put into articles of greater depth.

The mission is not to gain a wider readership. The mission is to gain a wider writership.

The vision is to help people remember the important aspects of their lives. By remembering they will help relive. In reliving they may not be retired, they may be rejuvenated. At the same time, they begin to recover the utility and agency that elders have provided in ages past: the wisdom of the ages passing on to the succeeding generations.

The old people teaching the young people. Instead of passing away in front of the screen or book, elders are the ultimate influencers.

Even better, when its the elderly themselves banding together, forming groups, and teaching each other in order reestablish a position of respect and influence in society.
