It is fitting that September's moon is called the Full Harvest Moon.  This full moon rises soon after sunset.  Imagine the days before electricity and you will realize how important that was.  It provided much-needed light for the farmer to harvest her crops.

Here at the Heritage, it means our dining room staff will have extra light to prepare for the extra-special dining room re-opening events on Tuesday.

But what is it about a full moon that makes people do crazy things? Will you be sitting in your easy chair waiting for Wendy or Tiffany to knock on your door so they can bring in your meal? Or will you remember to get dressed and proceed down to the dining room? Fingers crossed: you make the right choice!

And this is also the first message sent by a resident to a Heritage residents email group.  Fingers crossed: it brings not a frown but a smile!
