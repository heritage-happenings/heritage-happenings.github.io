# Heritage Mailing List



## First message

Hello Heritage Resident

This message is simply to inform you that your email address has been added to a mailing list for Heritage residents. You don't need to do anything.

The idea of this effort: Encourage online dialog and camaraderie even when we are physically couped up in our apartments.

I will follow up with messages that will describe all of this in more detail. In the meantime, sit tight and wait for nice things to happen!

If you have questions or want to know more or want to help - just let me know.

Theo, Kathy and Patrick




## Second Message


Dear Heritage Resident

Welcome to a Heritage Residents news and happenings list! The address is: residents@ heritage.groups.io

If you have some good news to share about life at the Heritage, send an email to the above address. Your message will be copied to all 59 residents that have email addresses.

For example, here is some of the uplifting chit chat that I am hearing and would like to share with you:

Gardner will be released from quarantine on Wednesday. The four residents under observation over last weekend all tested negative. If we all test negative (again) next week the dining room will likely reopen and we will be permitted to have visitors. The movie in the McGinley room this evening will be Lady Chatterly's Lover. Sous-chef Sylie says: "The Baked Alaska with this evening's dinner should be sublime!" Maintenance has scheduled the work to have all taps supplying piping hot water in eight seconds to be complete by 2030,  (I will add and develop this text further as and when the message is scheduled. ;-)

Do you know about something nice happening at the Heritage? Do you have questions? If so, you can drop by my place, phone or message me and I will spread the news and help find answers. There are people here who are being affected by isolation and loneliness. Please send out some kindness and hope and share the warmth with your fellow residents.
