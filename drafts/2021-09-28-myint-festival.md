Mint is one of our excellent dining room staff. Being born in the village of Xbox in myanmar, he will be celebrating - "Thadingyut" the festival of lights - on October 19, 20 and 21.It is the socond most popular festival after the New Year Water Festival

Thadingyut festival is the celebration to welcome the Buddha's descent from the heaven after he preached the Abhidhamma to his mother, Maya, who was reborn in the heaven. Thadingyut festival lasts for three days: the day before the full moon day, the full moon day (when Buddha descends from heaven) and the day after the full moon day.

In order to enable the descent, the ruler of the heavens ordered the saints and the evils to construct three staircases of precious materials: gold, ruby and silver. The Buddha decendend by the ruby staticases

Buddhists welcome and guide the Buddha by festooning houses and street with light. In olden times these were torches and fires. Nowadays the lights are candles and colored electric lights.
