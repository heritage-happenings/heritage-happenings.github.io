# Impediments to mobility

A particular joy of life at the Heritage access to one of the best locations in one of the best cities. Enjoyment of this benefit depends on the mobility of each resident.  We are accustomed to think of oldsters getting about the city using a single cane. The interesting thing is that the paradigm is changing.

Out of 76 current residents, about 28 use rollator walkers, wheelchairs or two walking sticks. (A number of others rarely go out and are heavily dependent on the handrails). At least four use just one cane.

Why the change?
Walkers are cheap.

1. Amazon sell new four wheel walkers for $5
