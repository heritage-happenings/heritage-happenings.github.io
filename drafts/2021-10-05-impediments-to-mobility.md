# Impediments to Elderly Mobility

A particular joy of life at the Heritage is the access to one of the best locations in one of the best cities. Enjoyment of this attraction depends on the mobility - particularly the walkability - of each resident. Interestingly, the mobility of elders is currently in a state of transition and is generating significant architectural ramifications.

We are accustomed to think of oldsters getting about the city using a single walking cane. Elders have used canes to aid with mobility for millenmias. The interesting thing is that the paradigm is changing.

Out of 76 current residents, about 28 use rollator walkers / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_(mobility), wheelchairs or two walking sticks. (A number of others rarely go out and are heavily dependent on the handrails). At least four use just one cane.

Why the change?

1. Walkers are cheap. Amazon sell new four wheel walkers for $50
2. Walkers prevent falls. 2 legs + 4 wheels.
3. Walkers you move faster and carry stuff

What are the downsides?

1. Must take elevator. Walkers and stairs don't mix
2. Opening doors is a simply awful process
3. "Valet parking" of walkers in dining rooms gets to be tricky

The recent five day shutdown of the Perryu elevator was a significant impediment to resident mobility. But even with all the elevators running, a seriouis impedinet to resident mobility is the three eentrances.

Because of the steps, single person traversal of the front entrance by a person with a rolling walker is foolhardy, if not dangerous. In other words, the best, prettiest and nicest entrance is inaccessible to most residents most of the time.

Both secondary entrances require traversing car parks. While car parks are nice suburban things. They can be psychological downers to people who choose not to drive. It's like Tesla owners having to go through a gas station to get to their car.

Entering and exiting the campus via the Francisco Street and car park entrances pose significant safety issues that may not be apparent to people who are normally moble and have full use of two hands. Not only are they far less handsome, but they habve isues



The process takes time, requires coordination and demands patience.

Getting the key into the keyhole while leaning over the walker
Getting the key out the keyhole while holding the door open - because of the leaning and awkard angles can be quite troublesome
Moving the walker out of the doorway, opening the door, then manouvering the walker through the door all while keeping the door open can be exceeding tricky.

Cark Perk entrance:

* Mind the acorns and all the opther tree stuff. You never know when your shoe will roll over an acorn and you foot slips out from under you.

Francisco Street Entrance

* The big gate requires a big movemeny backwards while holding the door open
When you go through, the closing door makes a big clank, Fingers croseed the  person is a bit deaf
* The path throught the fdarden is narrow and winding. Who will be the first to fall over into a planting bed?
* The second entrance - into the Porter Library - start all over

Self-opening doors would be a game changer - this along with a thorough investigation of the ways the residents enter and exit their home and interact with their superlative neighborhood.
