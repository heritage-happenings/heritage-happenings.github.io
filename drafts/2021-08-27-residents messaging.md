# Residents Messaging

This is to let all you know that I am talking with Kathy KirkPatrick and Patrick Alexander about setting up an email messaging system just for Heritage residents.

Our hope is to foster more and better communication between residents. For sure, we seem to be stuck in their apartments a lot. But that should not hinder us from communicating.

The messaging system will be maintained by residents to benefit the lives of residents. It follows along with the way the Happenings newsletter is managed only by residents. Kathy, Patrick and I will get things going. Let us know if you want to help.

The messaging system wil be moderated. It may take a while for things to settle down. We don't want too many messages or too few. We hope that you will trust that the three of us can have a dialog with all residents in order to to create a system pleasing for all.

I hope that in as few days, we can send out a message al all residents announcing that start of the system. Heritage staff will not receive any of the messages. You won't need to do anything - ever. You can opt out any time.  We hope eventually that you will start send messages.


I am not sure that this email system will make sitting in your apartment more thrilling or exciting. I do hope, however, that we can share some good cheer, plenty of human warmth and a bit of good old-fashioned rumor and gossip.
