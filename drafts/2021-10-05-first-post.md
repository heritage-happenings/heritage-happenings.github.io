A Tip of the Hat to Terry

Wednesday, October 6 is Terry Moughan's birthday. Did you know that Terry is a man of many hats - firguratively? For example, did you know that Terry - apart fron being an insurance agent - along with his wife completed running a number of marathons. And Terry is also a man of many hats - literally. As you may remember, Terry wears a different hat every. Each hat bears the logo of a university or sports team. He wears the hat to commemorate and celebrate of an event happening that day.

I don't usually wear a hat, but Wednesday night at dinner I will wear a baseball cap - just so I can take my hat off to celebrate Terry's birthday.

Two choice for the closing line:

1. Come to think of it: if you wear a hat to dinner, you can help Terry to celebrate too!

2. Fun idea: lots of us wear hats to dinner and we all help Terry celebrate his birthday!
