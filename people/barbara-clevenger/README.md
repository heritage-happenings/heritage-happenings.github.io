First paragraph of the text of Barbara's 1989 paper:

> This is a paper written on a Julia Morgan house listed in Sarah Boutelle’s book, “Julia Morgan, Architect” 1995 edition on page 252, Morgan Job No. 345, Oakland Building Permit 25014 of August 21, I908. The address
listed is: 1524-29th Avenue, Oakland, CA . Twenty-ninth avenue is an extension of Park Street in the city of Alameda--driving due east on Park you cross the Park Street Bridge over the Estuary and it turns into 29th
Avenue, progressing through Kennedy Tract, crossing East 14th Street (where the house resides in the middle of the block) and terminates at 17th Street where it meets Hawthorne Elementary School. Also note
references to it in Mark Wilson’s “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Living-Legacy-Historic-Architecture-East/dp/0938530380" target="_blank">Living Legacy, Architecture in the East Bay</a>.”

See also similar project: Park Congregational Church also by Hugo Storch: http://berkeleyheritage.com/berkeley_landmarks/sbcc.html. Both projects are surprisingly modern - being absent of almost any decoration - and quite idiosyncratic - incorporating a belfry and roof terrace design of a type never seen before or after.

>It might be harder to explain the omission of a dorm-style building at **1524 29th Ave. in East Oakland**. That would make a compelling site, certainly, for the sickle-cell-anemia project the Panthers operated on the premises for a while, but surely even more so for the fact that this was the barracks where a police raid netted an arsenal of guns stockpiled on the premises – automatics, rifles and enough ammo to stage a mini-Waco.
>
>The guns, to supporters, were mute testimony of Panther intent to foster self-defense in the black community. Harder to explain would be the mysterious back-yard pit police discovered then (these days the pit is host to swings and other play equipment, and the dorm itself is a halfway house for parolees and drug-recovery patients). Called “the mud hole,” the pit was a draconian Panther creation to “discipline” errant members in the early days of the party. (Another Panther dormitory, on Adeline Street, had a similar mud hole.) The roughly 4-by-4-foot hole was filled with cold water. The victim was “sentenced” to remain in the hole naked, receiving blows from other Panthers who ringed the perimeter, and then forced to remain all night in the bone-chilling water.

> The raid on the Panthers in Oakland is an excellent starting point. The official story on this raidHas such glaring holes that it's difficult to interpret it as anything but a conscious effort at harassment. consider:

> Why did the police busy that house at **1524 29th Ave in Oakland**? The Berkeley police who initiated the April 15th 5 AM raid got a search warrant to try to find one person, Leonard Colar, alleged participant in a beating in Berkeley the night before. The hitch: Colar lives at 184630 1st St in Oakland, clearly stated on his driver's license and car registration both current.
