2020-10-11 ~ Here we go!

Thank you testing this web site!

As with so many first efforts, there is a lack of content and a number of design issues.

Fingers crossed: both these issues are dealt with in due course. In the mean time, please send your comments, thoughts and suggestions to Theo.

To do: make the size of the text adjustable. Establish high priority items needed so people with disabilities may access the content more easily.
