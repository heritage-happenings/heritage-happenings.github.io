# Five questions

The are two ways of arriving at simplicity

1. Reduce complexity
2. Avoid complexity

This effort is definitely a #1. In general: any effort by me will find complexities where there were none before. ;-)

"We have met complexity. And she is us!"

The core premise here is to follow:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer

> God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
> courage to change the things I can,
> and wisdom to know the difference.

In order to step through this mission, this study follows an oft-used triadic structure - knowing-being doing

1. Ask three questions to understand or to know what is going on
	* To understand what we can and cannot change
2. Ask two question to plan or to judge or gauge the best that can be
	* To use the acquired knowledge to give us the wisdom to make a plan
3. A third aspect - doing or acting upon the first two, carrying ot the plan - happens after the first two are well-underway
