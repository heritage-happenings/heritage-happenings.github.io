# Theo's first impressions

## Preface

soon after I moved in I decided I wanted to write down my first impressions of the heritage. I thought that making a list of 21 items would be good.

the list keeps getting longer and longer. I just thought it would be a good thing to put the items into categories. so I started looking into the different refuse to recommend Independent Living centers.

the new categories added more items to my impressions list.

perhaps a better title for this document might be "Theo's endless impressions"
