# Quarantine

Aggie:

The thrust of the article is to be upbeat - without in any way whitewashing or denigrating a seriously awful experience. The idea is to help residents come to terms with a prospect that they too may one day have an experience such as yours.

Below are several suggested questions. Rather than answering all the questions with a few words each, tt might be nice if you provide a response to two or three of the questions with several sentences that might provide insight.

Did you have any thoughts that kept recurring that you can share?

What did you miss the most?

Did you come with any good tricks to amuse of divert yourself

Did anything new happen?

Did you find a way of keeping fit?

What was the worst thing of the quarantine?

Is the a memorable aspect that is positive?

Were you able to accomplish anything interesting?

Are there any things the Heritage could do to ease quarantines in the future?

Extra bonus points if you come up with your own question - and answer it as well. ;-)

I am also interviewing Yvonne. I may do Marian and Gardner as well. In any case, I will send you the draft for your OK before sending it on to Margaret.

You suvived a very difficult experience. Thank you for being will to share your experience. I look forward to hearing your thoughts
