## If Disney Ran Your Hospital: 9 1/2 Things You Would Do Differently

* https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Ran-Your-Hospital-Differently-ebook/dp/B004O0UD7M

> 2005 ACHE Book of the Year. The 9 1/2 principles in this highly personal and refreshingly written book will help any hospital team gain the extraordinary competitive advantage that comes from being seen as "the best" by their own employees, consumers, and community. It takes profound knowledge, not usually taught in business schools, to create and maintain an environment where people feel they are working with friends who share a common dream of making patients and communities their loyal fans - a place where: Employees say, "I love to work here." Managers say, "I love the people I work with." Caregivers say, "I love our patients." Patients and families say, "We love this hospital." Loyalty is an organization's best source of long-term strategic advantage. But unlike traditional service organizations, Disney does not provide a service. Neither does your hospital. They both provide an "experience".
>
>Disney is the premier example of this newly evolved economic category, and hospitals would do well to emulate the most vital things that earn Disney the love of their guests and employees. Like his popular seminars, in these pages Fred Lee addresses the vexing reality that most of our approaches to patient satisfaction will not lead to patient loyalty. He takes aim at service excellence initiatives, quality and performance improvement efforts, and patient satisfaction surveys, dispelling some of our most cherished beliefs about loyalty and leadership.
>
>This captivating book, filled with stories and examples, will leave its readers inspired with fresh insights and energized with hope. It needs to be in every hospital manager's library and required reading in every health care leadership curriculum. If you have wondered why so much of what is done in the name of service excellence in health care has not lived up to its promise, this book is for you.

## Taking the Cue: What Hospitals Can Learn From Disney

>What does Disneyland have in common with a hospital?
>
>Most might be inclined to say very little, but a new program launched by the Disney Institute last month is trying to change that assumption. The Lake Buena Vista, Fla.-based Institute now offers a professional development program for hospitals, called Building a Culture of Healthcare Excellence. It focuses on the same five philosophies that have made Disney enterprises so successful: leadership excellence, people management, quality service, brand loyalty and creativity and innovation.
>
>Disney's program reflects a larger trend of healthcare organizations adopting best practices from outside industries. For example, in the past, many hospitals found success with the Toyota Production System style of business, which gave birth to "lean" processing. Disney's program, however, focuses less on the operational and more on the patient experience and brand loyalty. HCAHPS and consumer surveys have indicated the consumer's role will only grow, and Disney wants to help hospitals meet that challenge by understanding that patient experiences are about more than what happens at the bedside. (Hint: it also involves a hospital's employee orientation, parking lot and website.)
