# Morris Grass Fed Raising the Steaks


Here at the Heritage we eat a fair amount of meat. A good portion is red meat and for the most part it is nicely cooked, elegantly served and a tasty delight. What more could you want? What could be better than the darn good meat Morrison is preparing?

Are you ready? Well imagine eating a cut of meet raised, nourished and slaughtered by a man who can say this:

"I've loved being a cowboy from the time I could walk. I have always been taught by my family, you ought to do something you love. Love is an enormously powerful economic principle that is largely ignored in the money economy. To me, sustainability means reconnecting communities of people to the produce of the farms and ranches. To do that, we need to decentralize the food system, and make direct connections between farmers and people, so people know how their food is produced. Then corporate farms that are largely faceless wouldn't have the edge over people with faces in the community."

The person speaking here is Joe Morris, son of Heritage resident of Anne Morris and Chief Honcho at Morris Grass Fed. Morris Grassfed produces 100% pasture-raised beef, grown on the California central coast. Their USDA dry-aged beef is cut & wrapped by artisan butchers. Cattle are born, raised & finished on certified organic pastures.
