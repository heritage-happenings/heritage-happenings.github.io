## Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 are United States federal regulatory standards that apply to all clinical laboratory testing performed on humans in the United States, except clinical trials and basic research. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has the primary responsibility for the operation of the CLIA Program.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and health insurance portability standards. In addition to these programs, CMS has other responsibilities, including the administrative simplification standards from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), quality standards in long-term care facilities (more commonly referred to as nursing homes) through its survey and certification process, clinical laboratory quality standards under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, and oversight of HealthCare.gov

In the fight against COVID-19, having multiple tests for different settings and stages of a person's infection is key, from high-volume laboratory capabilities to fast solutions that give results on the spot, from tests that detect the active virus to tests that detect antibodies in people who were previously infected. The portable, rapid molecular ID NOW COVID-19 test has emerged as a critical part of this arsenal, allowing fast diagnosis — with results in 13 minutes or less — in a variety of locations such as physicians' offices, urgent care clinics and other point-of-care locations. Find out more about this innovative technology and its impact here.

ID NOW COVID-19 assay performed on the ID NOW Instrument is a rapid molecular in vitro diagnostic test utilizing an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology intended for the qualitative detection of
nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in direct nasal, nasopharyngeal or throat swabs from individuals who are suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider within the first seven days of the
onset of symptoms. Testing is authorized for laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, and meet the requirements to perform high,
moderate, or waived complexity tests. The ID NOW COVID-19 assay is also authorized for use at the Point of Care (POC), i.e., in patient care settings operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver, Certificate of
Compliance, or Certificate of Accreditation
