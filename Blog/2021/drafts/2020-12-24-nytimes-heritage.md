# 2020-12-24 NY Times Nursing Home Article

Dateline: 2020-12-24. Heritage on the Marina - a nursing home in San Francisco.

subtitle: _Old age is the final frontier most peeps are woefully unprepared for. We are pioneers of life entering uncharted territories. Choosing to age well_ Or find some good quote??


## A Difficult Decision
Color me alive, happy and enthusiastic. I live inside one of the best decisions I have ever made - one many might consider a demented choice. This past March I submitted my application to the Heritage. I was accepted and chose to move here in August. The decision to move and choice to enter a nursing home were not obvious: media have treated nursing homes as they might describe death camps; nursing homes are for oldsters and I am but 73; common wisdom portrays loss of freedom within the confines of a nursing home; fewer than 5% of older adults live in nursing homes. So why did I choose to come here?

## Where I lived was very nice
My 21st floor rent-controlled apartment had splendid views of San Francisco Bay. Safeway supermarket and Starbucks were downstairs. Within walking distance were some of the best restaurants in the world and otherse were some of the cheapest in the city. The walkability index is 96 out of 100. There are dozens of neighbors in their 70s and 80s.  If anything needed fixing, management often replied and fixed within 45 minutes. It was an ideal location to start a retirement. In so many ways life was idyllic for my fifties and sixties.

## Warning signs
I'm now in my seventies. I am a boomer. I am disabled. And I want to live long and prosper.

Signs made me question my lifestyle. On two occasions friends were found dead in their apartment. Walking down the halls, you heard what I call "Death by TV": people entertaining themselves until their end. Several neighbors were down to two or three remaining friends.

The pandemic made issues much more obvious. If your house cleaning team cannot visit, you are not cleaned. If they quit and you are ninety you are hosed. The building managers can manage a building. They cannot manage people congregating in your sparsely ventilated halls and elevators without masks. If you live by yourself then you are in a one person bubble and your in-person social life evaporates. Also living by myself, I tried to make sure I had three days of food and water, a battery large enough to run a laptop for several days. Envisaging a calamity arriving to your elderly self is not easy

## Issues
Being a fall risk, means that bathrooms, cooking, stairs are risky. Being the first of the boomers means that if I don't choose early the multitudes following me will take the best places. Being an intentional sort of person means that progressing into old age without guidance, procedures and mentors is asking for trouble. When I turned seventy, it was time to reexamine my life. I decided that my life needed change and chose to investigate independent living centers for the elderly.

## Bad things happening
Every nursing home in the United Stated is under the supervision of a municipality, a county, a state and a myriad of Federal agencies. Battalions of civil servants track the numbers. They make and monitor rules and guidelines with the  specific mission of keeping oldsters alive, warm, fed and active and publishing the numbers of any failures to do so.

There are no equivalent sources of data or guidelines for oldsters living at home.

Ever since the onset of the pandemic, nursing home have been headline grabbers. Why? It may be because statistics for nursing homes are the easiest to source and verify.

Contrast with the following

## A Happy Choice

## Mission and Vision
The Heritage has been looking after the destitute or the needy or the aged since 1853. They have a good track record, an excellent endowment and a five star rating. The mission is not to make money for shareholders but rather to help people live long and prosper.


## Features
The task of growing old involves the tasks of shopping, cooking, cleaning, housing, utilities, nursing, communicating, exercising, monitoring and enabling friendships and social activities. You wouldn't ask a ten year old to do these things. You should not ask a ninety year old to do these things. Places like the Heritage manage all these aspects of a life.

There have been zero cases of the virus among residents. Two cases among staff were identified before they spread.

## Sustainability
The residents have diversity with a fair number born in Europe and Asia, but there is a definite whiteness to the community. On the other hand, the staff have much diversity. And they are being managed by HR with excellent foresight. We are being looked after by people with health benefits, 401K plans, proper holiday and time-off pay. After just six months here just about every member of staff calls me by my name.


## Benefits
* There's no worry about growing old. My task is to grow better.
* You no longer worry that a child might interrupt their career to look after you
* You have a hundred friends always. Whenever an old friend dies a new friend is introduced
* If there an earthquake, fire or calamity, the peeps in the nursing homes are the first to be rescued
* You don't worry about depression or bankruptcies. Organizations such as the Hermitage can't just throw ild people out on the street


## Closing: a wise choice
This afternoon there were three socially-distanced gatherings of ten residents each. We sang Christmas carols. When it came to singing "Chestnuts roasting over an open fire" we were eating real chestnuts. When you live in a place where there is that much attention to detail, you know you have found your aging-well happy place.
