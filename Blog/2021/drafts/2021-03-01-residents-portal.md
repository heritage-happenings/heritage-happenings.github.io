# residents portal

_2021-03-02 ~ Theo ~ first draft of a Heritage resident online portal manifesto to establish primary goals

_decide to do_

1. Deliverable: An online presence where residents, staff, family and friends access resident-related  & resident-maintained data and tools via phone, tablet or computer that may be public or private

2. Mission for the present: provide reference material to residents in ways that speed up delivery time, reduce paperwork and personal hoarding, increase productivity via pretty, accessible and adaptable, easy-to-use tools

3. Vision for the future: Residents are more connected to family & friends; engaged and useful to society; aware or informed; active and participatory because what they need to know or remember or network is always available at their fingertips

_make progress_

4. Craftspersonship: The presence is secure, defensible, highly disabled-adaptable, end-user & staff maintainable, search-engine friendly, built using open-source tools & revision control and hosted with free long-term maintainability in mind

5. Replete: The presence eventually  supports a number of tools including a content management system, mailing lists, forum, gallery, simple database along with dashboard and admin capabilities. Social network access.

6. Managed process: The development process should be slow and steady. First running in parallel with current systems such as duplicating the data on the closed circuit TV channel, material distributed via paper dropped in mailboxes and material already on the web that is not normally available to residents

_improve with age_

7. Simple start: Material available in early version might include the monthly issues of the Happenings, re-posts of the Heritage Facebook, Twitter & LinkedIn posts, food-service menus and nutrients data. forms that need filling such as vaccinations, phone & email directory

8. Continuous enhancements: little-by-little, bios, photos, maps and floor plans, activities such the word games and news, access to books and news, integration with the library tools improve the Heritage

9. Ownership buy-in: The residents come to feel that it is their web-presence. Much like the current Happenings, the Residents web presence is quasi-independent of the Heritage and protected via a mutual respect among those involved

_share the love_

10. Leadership: From residents with significant dementia and severe disabilities to the aging whizz-kids there are possibilities to participate and engage in activities designed to support the many various  various abilities

11. Utility: The web presence provides residence with knowledge that their good efforts serve the community, will have a life beyond their own lives, will provide the serenity of access to beauty and security

12. Benevolence: The successes and failures of the Heritage web presence - useful stats, processes and checklists etc - are shared publicly with retirement communities and other interested parties around the world

1. Have an answer to the question “Why do you think we need a digital portal”
	A. Communication among residents
	B. Communication between residents and Heritage administration staff

2. Both in-house (password)and external portal
3. Can also have Heritage Happenings online
4. Can have important facts from the daily Heritage TV screening such as birthday’s and menus so residents don’t have to wait for other messages. Few people are watching the in-house TV on floor.  If residents looked at the daily menu online then they might be able to order faster.
5. Residents Library Committee can offer hints and lists to residents.
	A. Updated list of types and categories of of authors
	B.  Possibility of having online access through SFPL to read magazines and newspapers
as well as large print books. Large print books are difficult to buy in print format.
6. As residents will become used to online access—especially as we attract newer people in their 70’s—we can offer a free handheld devise (possibly such as kindle paperweight if it complies with SFPL online access). The paperweight could be given to residents as a Christmas present.

***

1. Can tell residents immediately about maintenance.
	A. Such as elevator not working (Tuesday); when will it be working again.
	B. TV service is down; when will it be working again.
