Why I write

I write to play with words
To amuse myself
To tell stories that might amuse others
To discover wisdom in the chaos of whirling thoughts
To share insights.

I write to give voice to thoughts and emotions too powerful,
too personal for the spoken word...as written words they
become tributes, eulogies, evocative poems.

I write to remember tomorrow what was important to me today.
I write to understand what shapes my life...the people,
the events, the history.

I write to connect the dots of my experiences
to give meaning to who I am.

I write to know that it matters that I am alive.
