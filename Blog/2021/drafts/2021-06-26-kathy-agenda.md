# 2021-06-26 Agenda

Mary Linde at 2021-06-25 Residents Council meeting said: "Committees need goals"

Here are some off the top-of-my-head thoughts that may relate to a facilities committee

## Mission

* Assist residents in identifying and bringing notice to new maintenance issues as they arise
* Share ideas and residents' wishes and needs dealing with managing the campus on an ongoing  and regular regular basis
* Plan for the future based on
	* SMART ( Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely) goals
	* FAST (Frequently discussed, Ambitious, Specific, and Transparent) goals
	* PURE (Positively stated, Understood, Relevant, Ethical )

## Values

We are not:

* A complaints committee
* A "just say yes" committee
* A platform for personal agendas

## Strategies

* We maintain a checklist of items we are involved with
* We inspect all visitable areas of the campus regularly
* We access work orders regularly
* We prepare agendas and keep notes of our activities


## Vision

Residents have a right to a residence that is

* Clean
* Quiet
* Free of disease
* Disabled-friendly
* Fitness encouraging
* Work and hobby friendly
* Access to good quality air and water
* Encourages socialization
* Architecturally delightful
* Promotes spirituality, collaboration and generosity
* Technically sound and up-to-date.
* Run in an economic and sustainable fashion

The vision helps up define what aspects of life at the HotM where the committee may be involved
