# Grass Fed Beef

Introduction: Erin Prosser & Joe Morris

Hi Erin and Joe

This message is to introduce both of you to each other.

The goal is to delight the residents of the Heritage on the Marina with a tasty and healthy tasting of Morris grass fed beef.

Resident Anne Morris and her family are pleased to take care of the costs of the beef.

As for other costs, I will be pleased to cover any reasonable and agreed costs above normal practices.

Supporting the American cowboy tradition is a good thing. Fingers crossed: taking part in a modern supply chain effort that is able to drive beef to market and on to the table that is healthy, sustainable and local - even briefly - will be even nicer.
