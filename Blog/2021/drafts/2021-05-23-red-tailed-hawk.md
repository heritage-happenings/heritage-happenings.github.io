# Red Tailed Hwak

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-tailed_hawk

I am "Hawkeye", the red tailed hawk you see gliding over the heritage from time to time. My breed - there are about a million of us in the States. is one of the most widely distributed of all raptors in the Americas. At around 10:09 am on May 7th, I was calmly dissecting a small rat in the parking lot of the Heritage. I heart eating rodents, so when that pesky murder of crows showed up, I was more than a little ruffled. The crows then mobbed me. I did my best but had to retreat. Fortunately, I had witnesses to the dining travesty.  Heritage Operations Director has remarked, "???" while Activities Coordinator Stephen Camarato exclaimed: "!!!"

The accompanying photo shows me just after this incident, regaining my composure while sitting astride the ridge of The Cottage. See how fierce and intense I look. Boy, was I good and angry! But you don't really need to worry. If you ever have seen a falconer with his birds, they are probably my cousins. My breed is the most popular with falconers. We Red-tailed hawks are highly tameable and trainable, with a more social disposition than other birds of prey.See you round the 'hood!
