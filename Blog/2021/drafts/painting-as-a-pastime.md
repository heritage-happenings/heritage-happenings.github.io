# "Painting as a Pastime" is Pitiful

A terrible book that is joyfully readable. A litany of logical contradictions that may make sense.

A self-serving rehash of random diary entries that make you smile as you squirm.

* no mention of the book!

## Intro

A reprinted version of "Painting as a Pastime" by Winston Churchill, first published in 1932 is now available in the Stuckey Library. As several reviewers have noted, the work is a "charming" read. On the other hand this is a concoction of 72 un-numbered, un-sectioned pages that cobbles together several essays first written in the Twenties into a load of illogical poppycock.

More pejoratives

* Perhaps a conflation of chapbook entries
* A collection of loosely connected _bon mots_
* charming, moderately enticing entreaty to display a conflation of contradictions

## Palimpsests contradictions

### Change vs Constancy

Churchill asks how do we stop stress and worry? First solution he suggests is ti change.

p2 "The element which is constant and common in all of them is Change."

In other words, the same thing is not the same. You must do the new, new, new.

Then, once you have made a change, he notes:

p5 "This is not a business that can be undertaken in a day or swiftly improvised by a mere command of the will. The growth of alternative mental interests is a long process. The seeds must be carefully chosen; They must fall on good ground; they must be sedulously tended, if the vivifying fruits are to be at hand when needed".

You must do the same, same, same.


### Time for a Surprise

audacity & speed vs caution & patience

p24 "First quality that is needed is audacity. There really is no time for the deliberative approach."

p49 "When I get to heaven I mean to spend a considerable portion of my first million years in painting, and so get to the bottom of the subject."


### Off-topic ~ Writing is a great hobby

If you are in the middle of writing about Thing A, then writing about Thing B may be considered off-topic. Then if you write about consuming Thing Bs when you yourself are very well known for creating ThingBs then, well, we call all have a good laugh.

Here is the example: Churchill allots nine of his 72 pages to tell you that reading books is a great hobby; this is in the book you are reading which happens to be in a book on painting. Conversely, prolific writer Churchill makes no mention of writing as a hobby.

## Muddled Metaphors

The objective of a metaphor is to help you understand a concept by showing you how it resembles a concept you may be more familiar with. In order to familiarize you with the world of oil painting, Churchill describes the process by describing how the painting process resembles being an army general commanding troops fighting a battle. Well actually I am more familiar with painting tha battling, so using painting as a metaphor for battling may be more fun.

### Travel ~ The end of our little journey

We are now nearing the end this little tour guide. The army trumpets are blaring, the coffee table is piled high with books to read. We await the climax. We are at the moment we have been waiting for: "Why paint?". "What is the good of painting?". Ta Da! Churchill has the answer: p68: "Painting is a spur to travel". Thank goodness the obligatory contradiction arrives swiftly: "if only the sun will shine, one does not go beyond one's own country". in order to be moved to paint, there is a need to travel or there is no need to travel."

### Recommendation

You should read this book for its engaging collection of logical contradictions. Books like these are a waste of time for which there is mo better use.

As a work of fiction it's quite moving but the storyline is weak. As a work of non-fiction it's quite wobbly. It's sits somewhere in the middle between the two: part essay and part fable. As Churchill notes "It is a mistake to read too many good books when quite young." Well, "Painting as a Pastime" is a good one for the whippersnappers.
