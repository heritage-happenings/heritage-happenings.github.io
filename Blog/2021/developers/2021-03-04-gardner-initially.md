# What to Initially Have in a Resident’s Digital Portal

A Few thoughts that we might consider discussing at our next
meeting. I’ve included more listings than we need so we can edit.

* Heritage Happenings
* Emergency (tells us that the elevator or TV is out of order)
* Resident’s directory (Names, telephone, email, room number)
* Sections of the in-house TV (such as menu and birthdays)
* When a moving truck will be blocking the parking lot
* Sign up Sheets (Out and About, Tess, Special Events)
* Maintenance Requests Online Version
* Library. List of books. New Books (perhaps with summary) Resident’s can list books they want. How to access books and media through SFPL.
* Committee Sign Up Sheet
* Who is on the Heritage Digital Portal Committee
* Solutions for Problems With Computers and Ipad’s
* Best Way Staff Can Contact Residents (cell phone/computer)
* Dining. How to tell dining if you loved their food. Suggestions to add or rearrange food items.
* Floor plans and written description of Heritage locations.
* Tell us What You Want. Residents can tell portal committee what they want.
