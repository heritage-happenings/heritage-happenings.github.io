## Age Contextual User Experience

As you age you may lose some of your abilities to see, hear, touch, smell and taste as well as having issues remembering.

Similarly, when you were a young child your abilities to see, hear, touch and smell as well as having issues remembering were not yet well formed.

In either case, you would no want to be be identified as "disabled" or being a "basket case"

You are what you are at whatever age. When you cry or laugh, there is no one that cries harder or laughs deeper than you can.

It is with this perspective of acceptance that we desire to build a web presence for your future self.


## Links of Interest: Accessibility

We seek to provide accessibility for all residents. In doing so, we must stand on the shoulders of giants. We must follow evidence-driven efforts. We must code in ways that permit us to follow evolving standards. We must become acutely aware of the various abilities of our constituencies. We must do our net to negotiate with our varies biases.

>Web Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) is a technical specification published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that specifies how to increase the accessibility of web pages, in particular, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.

>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.
>
>It supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used in applications can be passed to assistive technologies when there is not otherwise a mechanism. For example, ARIA enables accessible navigation landmarks in HTML4, JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more.

## Links of Interest: Content Management Systems

A modern web site takes thousands of lines of computer programming instructions in order to fly.

The industry standard "library" software modules used to create the kind of site we need is named WordPress written by a company call Automattic. The misspelling is intentional. the founder's name is Matt Mullenweg.

The current HotM web site is built using WordPress.

I loved WordPress when it was small and easy to understand. It has now grown up and become big, complex and less lovable. So it goes.

## Developers

The task of taking the cornucopia of WordPress offerings, gathering content and images and massaging these int a web presence is often carried out be a web developer. The are firms with project managers and programmers.

There are "small" developers that will build sites for a very few thousands of dollars. The geral cost is, say, five thousand to a few tens of thousands depending on the number of features.

## Issues at hand

Very few developers are well versed in building highly accessible, secure wen sites.


We want to see and be able to play with several sites designed with accessibility in mind designed by the prospective.

Personally, I would accept a developer with little or nor accessibility experience if they agreed to run through a number of iterations at no charge or on a pro bono basis
