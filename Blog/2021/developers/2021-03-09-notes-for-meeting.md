# 2021-03-09 Notes for Meeting

An upgrade that would improve quality of life at HotM is improved communication paper documents and Touch Town screen via SMS or email messages

* See Gardener's list of TouchTown messages
* See "Page Types" below

The standard way for disseminating this type of information is via a mailing list program. In the olden days this was called a "listserv". Other forms have included Yahoo Groups and GoogleGroups.

If you have not worked in management in a large organization you may nor be familiar with mailing lists, but you have certainly been the recipient of spam. Spam is the use of mailing list programs invoked for evil purposes. When used with integrity, these mailing list programs become powerful repositories of organizational memory, enhance productivity and simplify processes.

Two mailing list managers currently popular are https://googlegroups.io and https://groups.io

There is a different variety of mailing list apps that are often used as sales and marketing tools. These include https://mailchimp.com and https://constantcontact.com. These are fine apps, but we should not touch them with a ten foot pole, because these apps are expensive, do not allow for replies and are not searchable.

The benefits of a "nice" mailing manager include:

* The content of all sent and received messages is online and searchable
* Membership management and subscription options are ead=sy to update by admins and users
* Conversations and threads may be tagged and cataloged

Improving communication - particularly of the paper Touch Town data - should be "topic A" when we next meet with staff.

Questions to ask

* Theo can handle but there should always be an available backup member. There needs to be a team.
	* Does any member of staff have any experience with mailing lists? If not, then wait for new CEO
	* Can mailing list management be added to the job description of any staff or contract-worker? if not, then wait
