What is a "Portal"? Oxford dictionary says the origin of the word is "late Middle English: from Old French, from medieval Latin portale, neuter (used as a noun) of portalis ‘like a gate’, from Latin porta ‘door, gate’"

In this spirit, a "Residents Portal" would be something that enables free communication both in and out.

Bernie, Margaret, Gardner and I - along with new committee member Tess Goldman - have had a meeting and several discussions. Also we have been discussed ideas with a number of residents.

In general (to my personal disappointment), there appears to be no urgent need for a resident actuated or driven website. Though nobody was against the idea, the typical response was "why?" or "what for?"

At the same time, the residents we talked to do have a number of valid communication needs. A prime topic of conversation was better access to the TouchTown information as well as announcements in general.  The significant issues are:

* The time it takes to view the screen you want to see
* The length of screen visibility being too long for the slides you do not want to see and too short for what you do want to see.
* Do not stop use of paper or TouchTown.Any new service must be in parallel with existing and NOT replacing existing

A typical solution for these issues is to make the information available by email and SMS using a mailing list app as used by larger organizations. The Committee has discussed the use of email in detail. The goal would be to have scheduled daily, weekly and monthly messages plus notification messages as needed. The idea is that you don't have to "go" to the information, instead the information comes to you. There has been good discussion regarding the enhancements to HotM messaging for residents, staff and prospects and investigation and research is to continue

BUT

This evening I looked up Touchtown / https://www.touchtown.com/ and, wow, there are good number of interesting and available features. And there are number that could be made available to residents including a phone app!!!!

I am wondering: would it be possible for residents to have a looksee into the TouchTown setup. And if so, could we have a hand in making it wonderful?
