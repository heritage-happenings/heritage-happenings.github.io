# Meeting


Sorry for being a bit slow on all this.

It would be nice to have a face-to-face (mask-to-mask ;-) before Tess' Texas Trip.

If Tess finishes with her clients we could meet with her around 4:00 pm in the McGinly Room. If Tess is still busy at 4, we others could meet elsewhere.

Items for discussion

Observation 1
Gardener and I - at our various dining table roulette encounters - have chatted with a small number residents about an online HotM presence.

Anecdotal summaries of responses:
0% said "Yippee!"
100% said "Don't take away my paper"
50% said "Huh?"
50% said "Why?"

Observation 2
I started a paper on a simple starter website for HotM Residents that identifies the different accessibility requirements involving sight, sound, touch and memory. The paper is already horrid. It's complicated, technical and too long even though it's not long enough to get the job done.

Observation 3
Gardener prepared notes of our previous meeting and he also prepared a list of the touch town screens.

Most everything in both lists is about the communication of simple static data

Conclusion-in-progress
More than a digital data or process management issue, what HotM could use is - simply - more effective communication.

Better use of simple email and texting technologies could help most residents to access useful information more frequently using technology they are already familiar with.
