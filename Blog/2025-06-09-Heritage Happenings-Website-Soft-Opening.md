# Heritage Happenings Website Soft Opening

You are invited to have a look at this new reincarnation of the _Heritage Happenings_ website.

You are asked to consider and comment on the usability and suitability of the current implementation for an audience of elderly people.

Matters to consider at this stage:

* The audience is made of of people with highly varying physical and cognitive abilities
* They will access this site from all manner of devices ranging from flip phones to TV room monitors accessed with Windows and Apple operating systems
* The site must be attractive enough to build up a core of regular users and contributors

The most helpful comments at this stage are errors and fails on specific devices. For example I have not tested the site on actual Apple products, but only on simulated Apple products.

A particular aspects the the ease of use of the "Hamburger Menu" (☰) that appears at top right when viewing the website on a phone or small tablet.

At his stage, the actual content is still very much a work in progress. The general idea is that each post will have an image followed by text of one or two hundred words. From time to time there will be longer posts with up to five hundred words. The current set of posts are more or less placeholders in order to help you explore the usability.

I look forward to hearing your comments and suggestions.

Theo Armour
