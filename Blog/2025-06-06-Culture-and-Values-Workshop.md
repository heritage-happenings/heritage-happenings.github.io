In order to facilitate the process of affiliating with another organization, Margaret and Rod organized a workshop to help us come up with a list of our values - the aspects that help us define what we appreciate about our lives at Heritage on the Marina. 

A focus group ws organized with tables of six. We were asked to respond to the questions in the image above. Approximately 40 residents participated. Dozens of ideas and comments were collected. 

Rod will collate and organize these thoughts and present them at the next meeting.
