# Tasha Campbell: Heritage Tribute


## ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF

![Tasha Campbell](tasha-campbell.jpg)

Hello, Heritage on the Marina. I‚Äôm Tasha Campbell, the smiling security officer that you know from the past year and a half üëãüèæüòä. I wanted to take a moment to share a little more about me and thank you with an original poem as I leave for a new and better job opportunity.

## SPECIAL THANKS

A Special Thanks to Theo Armour, who inspired me with his thoughtful questions and encouragement to keep moving and do something fun. When the late Martha Nell Beatty was alive, he told me to connect with her so she could interview me for a profile in the Heritage Happenings newsletter. I always enjoyed reading it and was saddened by her passing in August. She was a sweet lady. Rest in Peace, Martha.

## SHORT and SWEET

I will try to keep this short and sweet. Haha. I was born 55 years ago to my loving parents, William ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Campbell and Joan Campbell. Dad worked for 20+ years for the Oakland Housing Authority as a manager for section 8 housing units near the Oakland Coliseum Bart Station. It‚Äôs now been redeveloped into affordable housing called Coliseum Place. Before her retirement, Mom worked for 20+ years at Owens-Illinois, a large maker of glass containers for the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries. I get my beautiful smile from and a positive spirit from her. Both of my parents have passed, my dad in 1999 and my mom in 2012. They are both resting in peace now. Both were active in the church, dad in the men‚Äôs choir and mom in the kitchen and making care packages for the homeless. In 1984, they bought our 3-bedroom family home in Oakland.  I still live there, with three housemates/tenants, that I rent two of the rooms and the garage to. So, when I'm not at work holding it down, keeping it organized and Zen, I'm at home as a live-in landlord, doing the same. Lol.

## TRIBUTE TO MY SECOND HOME

There‚Äôs so much in my heart<br>

## WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT FOR ME

After working in the security field these past 5 years, I am ready for a major change. I‚Äôm ready for a new environment and energy. I have accepted a new job in a completely new industry. I‚Äôll be working as a Lead Service Technician for a cleaning company that specializes in office, construction, and window cleaning. I‚Äôll be doing the office cleaning. The first client site that they told me about was Facebook, which I was excited about. There are two other potential client sites that are closer to where I live that I‚Äôm more excited about. The first company is the Clorox Company. The second is Abbott Laboratories. Both are big companies that have been around a long time and keep people healthy. After I complete training, I will have the opportunity to be hired directly with the company, with benefits after 90 days. I‚Äôm excited and ready for this new chapter, with activity, growth, and a much easier commute. Haha. In the meantime, the fun thing I‚Äôll be doing is playing indoor volleyball on Sundays with my team at the Eureka Recreational Center in the Castro. Living the dream, as Bob would say.

Much love,

Tasha Campbell
