# Living in Paris: Experiences and Insights

**_Date Line Paris October 27 2025_**

## Introduction

Living in Paris is a unique and enriching experience. The city is renowned for its vibrant entertainment scene, world-class museums, and a wide array of cultural institutions. Both residents and visitors have endless opportunities to discover and enjoy the diverse offerings Paris provides.

## Adjusting to French Customs

One of the first adjustments for newcomers is understanding the differences between French and American customs, especially in hotels. For example, elevators in Parisian hotels use the initials "RC" to indicate the ground floor, which stands for "rez-de-chaussée." In contrast to the United States, where the first floor is the ground level, in France, the first floor is above the ground floor. Therefore, to reach the street level, you should press the "RC" button instead of "1," as the first floor in France is a residential level rather than an exit.

Time periods in France are mostly given using the 24-hour clock as opposed to the 12-hour clock in the USA. For example, 8 o’clock in the evening is written as 20h00.

Temperatures are shown in degrees Celsius not Fahrenheit.

## Getting Around the City

Paris is mostly flat, which makes walking between destinations quite easy. However, for those who prefer not to walk, the city offers several convenient transportation options. The Metro, the city's subway system, is a popular choice for getting around. While single-trip tickets are available, they can become expensive for frequent travelers.

Many people choose to use a Navigo card, which can be renewed for various periods. The Navigo card is valid on both the Metro and city buses, making it unnecessary to purchase individual tickets for each trip.

## Metro Stations and Assistance

Every Metro station has an attendant in a booth. If you need help, you can ask the attendant for a Metro map, which is very helpful for navigating the extensive transit network in Paris.

## Finding Directions in Paris

For additional help with directions, the City Mapper app can be downloaded to your smartphone. By entering your destination, the app recommends the best Metro lines or bus routes to take. If you prefer to walk, City Mapper also provides walking directions, including street names and the direction you should head.

## The Food Scene in Paris

The French have a deep appreciation for food, and Paris is full of eating establishments. The simplest is a café, which mostly serves coffee or tea and may offer a limited menu. Next are bistros, then brasseries, and finally, restaurants at the top of the list. Each type caters to different tastes and experiences. Nearly every street in Paris has multiple places to eat. While most restaurants require reservations, brasseries, bistros, and cafés generally allow walk-in seating.

## Museums and Cultural Institutions

Paris has many famous landmarks, such as the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, and Notre Dame. These are all worth visiting, but they can be very crowded with long lines, so going early in the morning is recommended to avoid the crowds. In addition to these major attractions, there are numerous smaller museums, churches, and art exhibitions that are less crowded and well worth a visit.

An enjoyable outing is taking the Metro to the Jardin des Plantes, a large park that features an excellent museum and a menagerie, which is a small zoo. At the lower end of the park, you can board the Batobus, a hop-on, hop-off boat that travels along the Seine River, stopping at all the famous sites and offering a wonderful way to see the city from the water.

Greetings to all at Heritage.
