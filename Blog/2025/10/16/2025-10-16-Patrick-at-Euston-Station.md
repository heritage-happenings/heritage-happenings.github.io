# Patrick: Bomb Scare at Euston Station

**Dateline London Saturday October 11 2025**

I was due to catch the train from London to Manchester. It was scheduled to leave from Euston Station at 11:13am.

In order not to miss this train I arrived at Euston about 10:30am by taxi. So, I sat down on some seats facing a giant display board which showed which train was leaving and from which platform.  

At about 10:50am my 11:13 train showed up on the display. The display showed the train departure in the color brown, and it was listed as “Preparing” which meant that you could not board yet and there was no platform assigned to that train yet.

Some minutes passed waiting for the screen to turn green which meant that there was a platform assigned to the train and boarding was allowed.

Suddenly there was an announcement over the loudspeakers for Chief Inspector Lewis to come to the control room. The announcement kept being repeated several times only to be followed by another announcement saying that there was an emergency and all passengers should leave the station immediately and security personnel would assist in the evacuation.  

Good luck with that. The security personnel had already left the station. In fact, they were the first ones out of the door. No doubt worried that if a bomb went off, they might be the ones blown up.

No other passenger, including myself, made a move.

Just then the display screen flashed green and the 11:13am train to Manchester would be boarding from platform 5. Still, no one left the station in spite of continued exhortations from the loudspeakers to do so. Instead, there was a huge rush of folk to platform 5 to get on the train. This included myself and my suitcase.  

There were two old people, a woman and a man. They both seemed about the same age as most residents at the Heritage. Their job was to check passengers’ tickets before boarding. I selected the line being checked in by the old lady. She had in her hand what looked like a very large eraser. It was white and had a pointed end. She pointed the pointy end at the QR code on your ticket. I don’t think it worked. There was no sound and no light and no one was being stopped. In fact, I think if you just had a QR code from a box of cornflakes you could get on the train. When I stopped to ask her if her hand-held device was working, she just said “Get along Love”. So, I just got along and boarded the train. Just as well I did because shortly thereafter the train proceeded to leave the station even though it was only about 11:05am – much earlier than the advertised departure time of 11:13am. I suspect the train driver did not want to be sitting in his train under a pile of rubble if a bomb did go off. After all, trains are very expensive things.

The fine print on your train ticket says thank you for travelling on their trains but then it states in no uncertain terms that there are No refunds. No tickets are transferable, No substitutions. If you don’t use your ticket on that date, time and train you lose all rights to make any changes. So, I can see why no one wanted to miss the train even if there was a bomb scare.

It would have been a bad move on my part to leave the station when they asked you to. I would have had to buy another ticket on another train leaving God knows when.

This would have upset my sister no end. She expected to meet me at Manchester Station. She does have a cell phone which she doesn’t have a clue how to use. Most of the time when you call her cell phone she never answers. So, most of the time I just write her a letter. Unfortunately, this form of communication would not have worked in the case of a train delay.

The following day I checked the news. It turned out to be that someone had abandoned a package at Euston station and this had caused all the trouble.  Could be some desperate person had gone out for a smoke and had forgotten to take their suitcase with them.

And that folks was that.
