## New Email Address

For several years, residents have had the ability to send and receive emails using this email address: residents@heritage.groups.io.

For a variety of reasons, we are switching over to a new address: heritage.happenings.sf@gmail.com

If you are having any problems with receiving links to this newsletter in your email, please let Theo know.

## Protecting Resident Privacy

The _Heritage Happenings_ has been a moderately public document. The newsletter is distributed freely to residents, staff, family, friends, prospective residents and others.

The _Heritage Happenings_ Resident Directory, Floor Plans and Calendar have only been distributed to residents and staff.

As the publication moves into an increasingly online environment, it is worth considering what further protections of resident privacy might be taken.

### Privacy Policy Updates

Starting with the July articles:

* Articles will only refer to first names and family names will be omitted
* Photographs will not include names

If you have any further suggestions, please let the editorial committee know about it.
