Hello Residents

## Community Apps TouchTown Superpower

"Community Apps", the app on your phone formerly known as "TouchTown" that enables you to view what's on the TV screens at both ends of the Corridor has superpowers you may not know about. At dinner yesterday, Val brought these useful tricks to my attention and in turn I want to share some of them with you.

Did you know that you can use Community Apps to phone, text or email every Heritage resident and team member. In other words, you don't need to enter any of us in your address book on your phone; all our details are already on your phone and ready to click!

Here is a​ snapshot of my details in the Resident Directory. You can see that my phone number and email address are in blue. This means you can click them. When you tap on the phone number you start a phone call. When you tap an email address, you open your email app with the "To" already filled in.

There are many other interesting features available in the Community Apps. For example, the new resident handbook is available online. You can make a transportation request or reserve the guest room.

Here's another trick. The usual way to look at all the slides that are on the Corridor TV monitors is to click on "Announcements" on the home page. Loading all the announcements can take a number of seconds to complete. But when you click on "Feed" at the bottom of the page, just the pages for the current day load and and they load quite a bit faster.
