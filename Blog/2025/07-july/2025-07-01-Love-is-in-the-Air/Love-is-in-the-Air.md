# "Love is in the Air, er, in the Pavement"

Hi Residents

Walking with a walker and cane, I look down at the pavement more than most people. Here are three things on the pavement of Francisco Street that I photographed yesterday:

"I love you"

"Heart"

"Christy" (on the manhole cover in our driveway)
