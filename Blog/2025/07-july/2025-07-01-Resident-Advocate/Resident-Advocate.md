Hello Residents

[Advocacy Form]( https://heritage-happenings.github.io/Tips-and-Tricks\Advocate-Form-Updated.pdf )

At the recent Resident Council meeting, there was a discussion about Resident Advocates.

So, what is a Resident Advocate and why do you want one?

First, we have to explain HIPAA.

HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, is a US federal law enacted in 1996. It establishes national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge. HIPAA aims to safeguard protected health information (PHI) and ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

How does HIPAA affect residents?

If you should happen to fall ill and be taken to hospital, your friends and fellow residents cannot be given any information by Heritage Medical Staff. Because of HIPAA, our medical staff are sworn to secrecy â€” except for one special exemption.

Heritage medical staff are permitted to release your details status to a Resident Advocate appointed by you. Your advocate may then share your status with all of us.

A copy of the Resident Advocate form is attached to this message. Have a look at it!!

If you have not already, I suggest you think about and appoint your own advocate and get them to sign this form and drop it off at the Front Office.

Also, let me know who your advocate is and I will publish it in an upcoming edition of the Heritage Happenings Resident Directory.

Cheers,

Theo

PS My Resident Advocate is Yvonne
