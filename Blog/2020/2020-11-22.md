## Photo of the Day

The other day Gardner noticed that my mask was hanging way too close to the dirty end of my cane.

Here's the fix:

## COVID-19 Heads Up

I noticed residents in the parking lot talking to non-residents. All were wearing masks, but they stood much closer than six feet apart.

Remember to physical distance!


### Mask Wearing Kerfuffle

A respected Oxford University uses this study to state:

## Small mercies

Back in the good old days I could bend down with legs straught and touch my palm to the ground. But I have not been able to touch the ground even with my finger tips for several years.

Now my bathroom shower has lots of handrails. These greatly facilitate bending down while helping prevent falls.

Every day I can bend down safely to wash my feet. When I finish washing I have been able to straighten my legs and grab my ankle. But this morning I was able touch the floor with my finger tips.
