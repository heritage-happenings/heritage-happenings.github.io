## Cooking Comments

B: I really like the Strata, but I do wish the consistency were more like a quiche.


## COVID-19 Statistics for the Heritage neighborhood

I was hoping to see fewer cases this week because of the recent increased warnings, but that does not seem to be happening. ;-(

San Francisco new cases per day: 114 current / 105 previous

Heritage ~ Census Tract 129.02 ~ confirmed cases: 22 current / 22 previous

Here is link to a page on this website for tracking the statistics for the area around the Heritage:

## COVID-19 Heads Up

I want to save last night around 10 PM there were about 5 people in the store. I felt fairly safe.

Today I plan to drop clothes off at Marina cleaners but their doors are wide open so that should be OK. I also plan to go to goodwill and drop some clothes off. fingers crossed I can do this outside.


## Small mercies

I am trying to learn how to walk down the stairs again. I have been pausing briefly at each step. I want to go down with a continuous smooth motion. I especially want to stop coming down with a thud at each step because this most likely stress the knees and should be avoided in order to avoid knee surgery.

A nice thing about te stairs here is that there nice smooth handrails to both sides. This gives me the opporunity to slide my hand down the rail as I go down. If the hand slides smoothly and continuously as I go down, then I know my body and legs are sure to follow.
