## Heritage on the Marina Residents Portal

2021-03-02 ~ Theo ~ first draft of a manifesto to establish primary goals for the Heritage resident online portal

decide to do

1. Deliverable: An online presence where residents, staff, family and friends access resident-related & resident-maintained data and tools via phone, tablet or computer that may be public or private

2. Mission for the present: provide reference material to residents in ways that speed up delivery time; reduce paperwork and personal hoarding; increase productivity via pretty, accessible and adaptable, easy-to-use tools

3. Vision for the future: Residents are more connected to family & friends; engaged and useful to society; aware and informed; active and participatory because what they need to know or remember or network is always available at their fingertips


make progress

4. Craftspersonship: The presence is secure, defensible, highly disabled-adaptable, end-user & staff maintainable, search-engine friendly, built using open-source tools & revision control and hosted with free long-term maintainability in mind

5. Replete: The presence eventually supports a number of tools including a content management system, mailing lists, forum, gallery, social network access, simple database along with dashboard and admin capabilities.

6. Managed process: The development process should be slow and steady. First running in parallel with current systems such as duplicating the data on the closed circuit TV channel, material distributed via paper dropped in mailboxes and material already on the web that is not normally available to residents. Eventually: ???


improve with age

7. Simple start: Material available in early versions might include the monthly issues of the Happenings, re-posts of the Heritage Facebook, Twitter & LinkedIn posts, food-service menus and nutrients data, forms that need filling such as vaccinations, phone & email directory

8. Continuous enhancements: little-by-little, bios, photos, maps and floor plans, activities such the word games and news, access to books and news, integration with the library tools serve to improve the Heritage way of life

9. Resident buy-in: The residents come to feel that the portal is their web-presence. Much like the current Happenings, the Residents web presence is quasi-independent of the Heritage and protected via a mutual respect among all those involved


share the love

10. Leadership: From residents with significant dementia and severe disabilities to the aging whizz-kids there are possibilities to participate and engage in activities designed to support the many various abilities

11. Utility: The web presence provides residents with knowledge that their good efforts serve the community, will have a life beyond their own lives, and provide the serenity of free access to beauty and security

12. Benevolence: The successes and failures of the Heritage web presence - useful stats, processes and checklists etc - are shared publicly with retirement communities and other interested parties around the world

***

Theo: I have an additional list of things that did not make the cut to be in this first list of overarching goals. Such items may be added in the future
