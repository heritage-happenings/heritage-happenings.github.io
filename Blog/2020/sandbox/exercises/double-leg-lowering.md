## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Lie on your back and extend your legs straight up toward the ceiling. Rotate the legs out slightly, keeping the heels together and inner legs pulled in the center line, in Pilates stance. Point the toes. Place your hands behind your head, keeping the elbows wide and chest open.
2. Inhale. On the exhale, pull your abdominals down to the floor. Allow that motion to press your lower back into the floor <s>as you curl your upper torso up off the floor</s>. You will maintain this core strength torso position throughout the exercise. You are now in the starting position.
3. Inhale. On the exhale, keeping abdominals pulled in and pushing your back into the mat, lengthen your legs out of your hips. Begin to lower your legs slowly. The lowering motion should take longer than the lifting motion. You can lower the legs in three stages as a variation, lowering the legs a third of the way toward the mat, pausing, and lowering another third.
4. When your legs are lowered as far as you can while maintaining control and alignment, pause.
5. Check your position: open chest, wide elbows, abdominals pulled in.

Repeat the exercise.

## Remember

* Head elevated
* Arms flat
* Squeeze the glutes ( tighten butt )
* Draw belly button into spine
* Not to hold breath while going up
