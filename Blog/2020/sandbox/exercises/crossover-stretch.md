## Remember

* Don’t allow the foot on the floor to slide toward the middle of your body (across the floor) when you rotate the ankle/knee junction down toward the floor.
* Make sure the bottom of the foot that is resting on the opposite knee is totally flattened to the floor.
* When switching sides, make sure to reset the feet and knees to hip width distance apart.
* Don’t hold your breath.


## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Lie on your back with your knees bent at 45 degrees and your feet on the floor. Have your feet and knees hip-width distance apart, and keep your feet straight.
2. Place your arms straight out to your sides at shoulder level (90 degrees), with palms flat on the floor.
3. Cross your right ankle over the left knee, and place your right ankle bone (that little part that sticks out) just above your left knee.
4. Take a deep breath in and slowly rotate your ankle/knee junction to the left, down to the floor, without letting the left foot slide across the floor. Preventing the foot from sliding across the floor is one of the keys to this stretch.
5. Your right foot should now be flat on the floor, along with the outside of your left leg.
6. Turn your head to the right (the opposite direction of your legs) and relax your neck and shoulders.
7. Press the right knee away from your body using the right hip muscles (don’t use your hands for this step).
8. Flatten the palms of your hands and fingers to the floor.
9. Breathe deeply through your belly, lower back, and sides, keeping your shoulders relaxed.
10. Hold this position for 1 minute, then keep your legs crossed as you slowly rotate back to the starting position.
Switch sides and repeat.

Tip: alternate which side you start with to keep your body balanced over time.
