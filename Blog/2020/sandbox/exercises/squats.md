## Remember

* Don't let your knees pass your toes
* Don't let your knees go inward
* Look straight ahead, don’t look down
* Open your chest and relax your shoulders
* Put your hands straight out in front of you. If they fall toward your knees as you squat down, that means that your back is rounded
* Keep your heels on the floor
* “Push” from your heels as you go up
* If you can’t do a squat without putting your weight on your toes, take the time to work on your mobility (especially in your ankles)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Find a foot stance that feels best for you. Pointing your toes slightly outwards helps some, but keeping them parallel is fine, too. If you’re not sure what’s best, start by putting your feet shoulder-width apart and pointed about 15 degrees outwards.
2. Tense your abs like someone is about to punch you.
3. Look straight ahead and stand tall!
4. “Sit back” – make sure to move your butt backward, don’t just bend your knees
5. Be careful to keep your knees in line with your toes, don’t let them cave in
6. Don’t forget about your upper body – look straight ahead and don’t round your back

Try to hit parallel depth with the squats - that means the back of thighs will be parallel to the floor.
