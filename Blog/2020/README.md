# <a href="" >Heretics Happenings Online</a>

_This is a pre-release version of a website for residents of the [Heritage on the Marina]( https://https://heritageonthemarina.org/ ). It is maintained by the residents. This is a work-in-progress project. Feel free to discuss anything!_

## Content Goals

This website provides

* Online versions of the data usually offered to residents on paper, including
	* The Happenings
	* Food menu nutrient information
	* Residents manual
* Links to external websites that may be of interest to residents

This site is a project to which anyone may contribute - please submit websites.

## User Experience Goals

The goal is to produce a simple website with very basic navigation.

It should readable by the built-in web browser that comes with:

* E-readers such as the Amazon Kindle
* Tablets such as the Apple iPad
* Laptops and desktops

The primary initial concern is the efficacy and usability of the menu on the left side of the page.
