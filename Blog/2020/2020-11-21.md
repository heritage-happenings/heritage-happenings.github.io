## Turkey Thyme

The turkey at dinner last night was served with fresh thyme. The thyme was so fresh, fragrant and flavorful that I flagrantly ordered - just in time - seconds of thyme.

### Things I do about touching things

As I move out and around the Heritage, I mostly need only to touch my walker or cane. I consider these to be part of my pod. Mostly nobody touches either of these except to disinfect them. The Three things I have to contend with: doors, elevator buttons and handrails.

Here are my personal guidelines:

* Avoid touching things in general whenever I'm not home
* Door opening out: Use my butt to push open the door
* Door opening toward you. Use inserted key to open door, then reach up high or down low on the door. Aavoid touching the door handle
* Use your foot to prop open a door
* Use elbow - or knuckle to push elevator buttons
* wash or disinfect my hand upon returning home and soon after using a handrail

## Small mercies

_A places where I can share insights about things that make me feel grateful._

Until recently, I have not had to climb stairs on a daily basis since 1985. This is because ever since then I've lived on floors too high to climb.

Climbing stairs is a very good exercise, but not easy if you are a partial paraplegic with aging legs. Exercising is good but not if it takes time that could be better utilized for more important matters.

And ever since, I have had a mission to live on a low enough floor so that climbing stairs:

* is easy
* fits naturally into the pattern of daily routines

Now that I live on the second floor, and now that the dining room is open, it's nice to go up and down the stairs for each of the three meals. Going down to the basement to fetch the mail once a day is a bonus flight.

In just the few days since the opening of the dining room, I am noticing a gain in speed and reduction in effort with my stair-climbing abilities. In particular there are fewer shocks to to the knees as I go down the stairs.

If I ever live on the third or fourth floor I hope I would continue do the same, but for the moment I am deriving great pleasure in finding and building up this new strength simply by just going about a normal daily life.
