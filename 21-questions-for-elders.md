# 21 questions for elders

_This is the umpteenth draft of a work-in-progress. And It's only he first half. The second half will be my answers to these questions from my perspective of a resident at the Heritage on the Marina and from my perspective as a resident of The Gateway apartments._

One day you look in the mirror and say to yourself "Wow! I look just like the old people!".

When thoughts like these start to happen, it is a good time to as question like these:

* "Is where I live now where I want to be from now on?"
* "Will I want to live here in my nineties and beyond"
* "Will my friends and family want me here when I am a fall risk, have dementia or have had a stroke?"
* "Will I be lonely, become a hoarder or retreat into unhealthy habits if I stay here"
* "Wil I become a burden on my friends and family, will I disrupt the career plans of others so that they mat look after me, will the time spent fussing over me take time away from being with children?"

The following is checklist of a series of questions intended to help you gather the input needed to help you and your team agree a decision about your future life.

You may use this checklist in order to help you decide whether you should live in place or move somewhere else. If you are a stay-at-home, you will still need to find good responses to all the items.

_The wording of each question needs further definition and clarifying of the meaning. The bullets with aspects to consider need further augmentin and completing._
